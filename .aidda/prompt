# PromiseGrid Routing 

## Meeting Objectives

- **Finalize routing strategies** for PromiseGrid.
- **Gather feedback** on the complexity and potential pitfalls of proposed routing mechanisms.

## Overview of Routing Strategies

### 1. Exchange Rate-Based Routing
- Nodes route based on the exchange rates of personal currencies.
- Prefer routing to nodes with higher-valued currencies to ensure stability and reliability.
- Encourages nodes to maintain strong reputations and economic value.

### 2. Reputation and Currency Mechanisms
- Reputation points function as a currency, influencing routing decisions.
- Nodes decide to route based on the perceived value and reliability of other nodes.
- Market dynamics dictate routing paths, promoting decentralized control.

### 3. Handling Misbehaving Nodes
- Nodes that misbehave receive less network traffic and forwarding services.
- Poor behavior leads to reduced currency value, decreasing a node's network influence.
- This self-regulating mechanism ensures network stability and security.

## How Personal Currencies Work: "Everyone is Their Own Central Bank"

### Concept of Personal Currencies
- In PromiseGrid, **every node acts as its own central bank**, issuing its own currency in the form of reputation points.
- These currencies represent the node's trustworthiness and reliability, similar to how fiat currencies reflect the stability of a government.

### Incentives and Disincentives for Maintaining Currency Value
- Nodes are incentivized to maintain the value of their currency (reputation points) by keeping promises and behaving reliably.
- A **high currency value** means other nodes are more likely to route traffic through or trade with that node, increasing its influence and participation in the network.
- Conversely, **bad behavior** (breaking promises, excessive querying, etc.) leads to a **devaluation** of the currency, reducing a node’s ability to transact and interact with others effectively.

### Tools for Market Participants to Maintain Value
- **Reputation Management**: Nodes can actively manage their reputation by fulfilling promises and avoiding behaviors that could devalue their currency.
- **Dynamic Exchange Rates**: By adjusting their exchange rates with other nodes based on behavior and market conditions, nodes can strategically protect their currency's value.
- **Selective Interactions**: Nodes may choose to interact only with other nodes that maintain a stable or high-value currency, reinforcing trust and reliability in the network.

## Import and Export of Resources in PromiseGrid

### Understanding Import and Export
- In PromiseGrid, **importing resources** means paying another node for storage space or computational power. This could involve storing data on another node’s hardware or outsourcing computation tasks.
- **Exporting resources** refers to being paid by other nodes to provide storage space or computational power. Nodes that export resources effectively "sell" their excess capacity to others on the network.

### Analogies to International Trade
- The concepts of importing and exporting in PromiseGrid are similar to international trade in the global economy:
  - **Importing resources** (buying storage or computation) can be likened to a country purchasing goods or services from abroad. Nodes spend their currency to acquire necessary resources they cannot efficiently produce themselves.
  - **Exporting resources** (selling storage or computation) is akin to a country selling its goods or services to other nations. Nodes receive payments in other currencies, which strengthens their economic standing and increases their influence within the network.
- Just as countries aim to maintain a favorable balance of trade to enhance their currency’s value, nodes in PromiseGrid seek to optimize their import and export balance to maintain or increase their reputation and currency value.

### Governance and Geopolitical Factors Influencing Currency Values
- In the real world, geopolitical factors, governance, and economic policies heavily influence currency values. Similarly, in PromiseGrid:
  - **Governance Decisions**: Nodes might make decisions that affect their ability to import or export resources. For example, a node that reliably exports high-quality computational resources might see its currency increase in value, akin to how a country with a robust export economy strengthens its currency.
  - **Network Effects**: The behavior of a node's peers and its relationships within the network influence its currency's value. If a node is part of a trusted coalition or "alliance" of nodes that consistently fulfill promises, this could positively impact its currency, similar to how international alliances and trade agreements can stabilize or increase a nation’s currency value.
  - **Economic Policies**: Nodes might implement policies regarding how much they are willing to export or import based on current network conditions. This is analogous to a country setting tariffs or trade restrictions to protect its economy or encourage domestic production.

## Evolution of Routing Strategies: From Concept to Current Model

### Early Considerations and Alternatives
- Initially, we explored several routing strategies, including:
  - **Pay-for-Flow**: Nodes paying others in their currency to receive packets, effectively incentivizing traffic flow to specific routes.
  - **Bond-Based Routing**: Treating routing decisions as financial investments, where sending a message through a node could be seen as buying a bond in that node's currency.
- While these approaches introduced interesting economic incentives, they were ultimately considered **too complex** for practical implementation. The need to manage immediate and deferred payments added layers of complexity that could complicate routing efficiency and network stability.

### Shift to Exchange Rate Routing
- The concept of **exchange rate-based routing** emerged as a more straightforward alternative, leveraging existing market dynamics without requiring complex transaction management.
- In this model, nodes prefer routes that align with the highest-valued currencies, ensuring they interact with the most reliable and stable participants.
- This approach naturally encourages nodes to maintain a strong currency, as higher value directly translates to better routing opportunities and network influence.

### Considerations for the Current Model
- While the exchange rate-based routing simplifies decision-making, it introduces new considerations:
  - **Market Volatility**: Exchange rates can fluctuate, potentially leading to instability in routing decisions if not managed carefully.
  - **Equity and Access**: Ensuring that less established nodes can still participate meaningfully in the network without being overshadowed by nodes with established high-value currencies.
- These challenges are part of the ongoing discussion to refine and finalize routing strategies that align with PromiseGrid's decentralized ethos.

## Discussion Points

1. **Complexity of Implementation**
   - What are the challenges in implementing these routing strategies?
   - Are there simpler alternatives that align with PromiseGrid’s goals?

2. **Potential Pitfalls**
   - What unforeseen issues might arise from using personal currencies in routing?
   - How do we handle situations where nodes frequently change their routing behavior?
