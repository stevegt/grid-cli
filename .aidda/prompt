The cache MAY BE a sequence matcher.  If true, then given a partial
sequence, the cache can return the complete sequence.  We need to
decide whether this is true, and we need to decide whether there can
be wildcards in the sequence.  

Describe existing implementations of sequence matchers, e.g. from
genetics, and detail how they work at the data structure level.  How
does a given sequence get matched with a stored sequence?  How does
the matcher decide whether a sequence is a match?  What are the
data structures used?  What are the algorithms used?
