improve 001-workflow.md

I'm writing a technical book.   The filenames are in the form
NNN-topic, where NNN is the sequence in the book.

I'm using a tool (aidda, AI-driven development assistant) that
reads a prompt file, sends the prompt and all of the markdown files to
GPT-4 via the openai API, and gets back one file (limited to one file
due to GPT-4's output token limit).  Aidda is written in Go -- please
use Go in any code examples you provide.

I'm trying to figure out how best to either take advantage of this
existing workflow, or modify this workflow or aidda itself, to
accomplish these goals:

- turn the files into a readable book
- merge similar files and remove redundant ones
    - not lose critical information during the merge or removal
- detect and resolve conflicting information
- reorder files for better flow in the resulting book

Make recommendations for how I can accomplish these goals using the
current workflow, or how I might modify aidda to improve the workflow.
Include best-practice examples using state-of-the-art AI tooling, and
use your imagination to invent new workflow and tooling for this use
case.

- I want to delete v2/doc/051-design.md, v2/doc/052-design.md, and
  v2/doc/053-design.md, but only if v2/doc/050-design.md completely
  covers the same details
- list any details in v2/doc/051-design.md, v2/doc/052-design.md, or
  v2/doc/053-design.md that are not completely and accurately
  covered in v2/doc/050-design.md
- list any details in v2/doc/050-design.md that are not found in
  v2/doc/051-design.md, v2/doc/052-design.md, or v2/doc/053-design.md

**Details in `v2/doc/051-design.md`, `v2/doc/052-design.md`, or `v2/doc/053-design.md` that are **not** completely and accurately covered in `v2/doc/050-design.md`:**

1. **From `v2/doc/051-design.md`:**

   - **Exchange Rate Routing:**
     - Detailed explanation of how hosts route messages based on the exchange rates of personal currencies.
     - Advantages such as encouraging reliability, economic incentives, and self-regulation.
     - How it works, including currency evaluation, routing decisions, and dynamic adjustments.

   - **Nested Messages and Kernel Arbitration:**
     - Discussion on modules unwrapping nested messages.
     - The kernel's arbitration is not always final, supporting modular design with task delegation through nested messaging.
     - Implications for delegated control and dynamic message flows.

   - **Combining `Accept` and `HandleMessage` Functions:**
     - Pros and cons of combining versus separating these functions.
     - Emphasis on acceptance as a promise message.
     - Examples illustrating both approaches.

   - **Integration with Church, Turing, and Chomsky's Concept of "Accept":**
     - Deeper exploration of how "accept" aligns with computational theory.
     - Discussion on promises all the way down and theoretical integration.

2. **From `v2/doc/052-design.md`:**

   - **Messages and Promises:**
     - Use of Multihash, Multibase, and Multicodec to autodetect formats.
     - Emphasis on messages being byte sequences with no inherent meaning to the kernel, interpreted by appropriate modules.

   - **Cache (Syscall Tree) Node Structure - The Ant-Routing Mechanism:**
     - Explanation of the syscall tree acting as an ant-routing mechanism.
     - How successful paths from previous calls are cached to optimize future routing.

   - **Open Questions and Suggestions for Document Improvement:**
     - Questions about reconciling byte sequence completion with explicit registration and hash-based routing.
     - Handling broken promises effectively.
     - Optimizing routing efficiency with multiple handlers.
     - Suggestions for including more examples, case studies, and visual aids.

3. **From `v2/doc/053-design.md`:**

   - **Responsibilities of Non-Sandboxed Modules vs. Core Functions of the Kernel:**
     - Detailed delineation of what the kernel handles versus what non-sandboxed modules handle.
     - Emphasis on the kernel managing message routing only, while non-sandboxed modules handle syscall-like operations.

   - **Combining `Accept` and `HandleMessage` Functions:**
     - Similar to `v2/doc/051-design.md`, but with additional examples and a focus on promises being all the way down.
     - Examples illustrating both combined and separate function approaches.

   - **Cache and Module Handling Specifics:**
     - Treatment of modules as caches with more detailed explanations.
     - Discussion on how the cache design aligns with byte sequence completion.

   - **Open Questions:**
     - Discussion on known microkernel architectures using capability-based security.
     - How microkernels interact with userland drivers.
     - Examples of existing microkernels and their handling of permissions and access control.

**Conclusion:**

- **`v2/doc/051-design.md`, `v2/doc/052-design.md`, and `v2/doc/053-design.md`** contain additional details and discussions not fully covered in **`v2/doc/050-design.md`**, such as exchange rate routing, nested messages, and specific open questions about microkernels.

- **`v2/doc/050-design.md`** provides a broader and more comprehensive overview of the PromiseGrid design, covering core concepts and detailed explanations of cache handling, acceptance, and the syscall tree.

- **Recommendation:**
  - If the specific details from the other documents (e.g., exchange rate routing, nested messages, module responsibilities, and open questions) are important, consider integrating those sections into **`v2/doc/050-design.md`** before deletion.
  - After ensuring all important details are incorporated, it would be appropriate to delete **`v2/doc/051-design.md`**, **`v2/doc/052-design.md`**, and **`v2/doc/053-design.md`** to reduce redundancy.
