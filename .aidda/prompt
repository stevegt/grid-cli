In 331-messages.md, discuss the following design:

- What if we don't even parse the incoming message into its binary
  form first, but instead simply start doing sequence matching on the
  message data, byte by byte, to decide how to handle the message?
  Handling might include multibase/multihash decoding, or some future
  kind of decoding that we don't yet have. This is sort of similar to
  the way the UNIX/Linux magic number system works, where the first
  few bytes of a file are used to decide what kind of file it is --
  there is even a little language for specifying these magic numbers
  in the file /etc/magic.  What are the pros and cons of this approach?
