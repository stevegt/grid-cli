Answer these questions in 220-graph.md:

In a sequence-matching graph, does the 'Children' field of a node
contain the next node in the sequence?  Or does it contain both previous
and next nodes?  

Are entire genomes stored in the graph?  Or are only the sequences of
interest stored?  If the latter, how are the sequences of interest
identified?  Are they identified by their position in the genome?  Or
are they identified by some other means?

Show an example of how a new sequence is added to the graph.
