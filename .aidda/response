### Sequence Matching Graph Documentation

#### 1. Overview
A sequence-matching graph is a data structure designed to match input sequences to stored sequences by traversing nodes and edges. Each node and edge in the sequence-matching graph has specific compositions that facilitate efficient sequence matching.

#### 2. Node Composition
Each node in the sequence-matching graph contains the following components:

1. **Label**:
    - A string representing the segment of the sequence at this node.
2. **Occurrences**:
    - A list of positions in the reference sequences where this segment occurs.
3. **Children**:
    - A map from sequence characters to child nodes, which represent the continuation of the sequence.
        
    ```go
    type Node struct {
        Label      string
        Occurrences []int
        Children   map[rune]*Node
    }
    ```

#### 3. Edge Composition
Each edge in the sequence-matching graph connects to a child node and represents the next segment in the sequence.

1. **Character**:
    - The character from the parent node's label to this edge.
2. **ChildNode**:
    - Reference to the child node.

    ```go
    type Edge struct {
        Character  rune
        ChildNode *Node
    }
    ```

#### 4. Example Structure

Consider a simplified example with "ACGT" and "AGT" sequences:

```plaintext
       (root)
       /   \
      A     A
     /       \
    C         G
     \         \
      G         T
       \
        T
```

#### 5. Input Sequence Matching
To match an input sequence to stored sequences in a sequence-matching graph, follow these steps:

- Starting from the root, traverse through the graph using the characters of the input sequence.
- At each node, follow the edge that matches the next character of the input sequence.
- If a suitable edge or child node cannot be found at any point, the matching process terminates without a match.

#### 6. Graph Traversal Mechanism
Graph traversal utilizes a recursive or iterative technique to explore nodes and edges.

1. **Recursive Method**:
    ```go
    func MatchSequence(node *Node, sequence string, index int) bool {
        if index == len(sequence) {
            return true
        }
        
        char := rune(sequence[index])
        if child, ok := node.Children[char]; ok {
            return MatchSequence(child, sequence, index+1)
        }
        return false
    }
    ```

2. **Iterative Method**:
    ```go
    func MatchSequenceIterative(root *Node, sequence string) bool {
        currentNode := root
        
        for _, char := range sequence {
            if child, ok := currentNode.Children[char]; ok {
                currentNode = child
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
    ```

### Examples of Matching
1. **Example 1**: Matching "ACGT" in the diagram
    - Starting from the root, traverse edges labeled 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. 
    - Successful match if all edges are followed correctly.

2. **Example 2**: Matching "AGT" in the diagram
    - Starting from the root, traverse edges labeled 'A', 'G', and 'T'.
    - Successful match if all edges are followed correctly.

### Advanced Questions Answered

#### Sequence-Matching Graph and 'Children' Field of a Node
In a sequence-matching graph, does the 'Children' field of a node contain the next node in the sequence? Or does it contain both previous and next nodes?
- The 'Children' field of a node contains only the next node(s) in the sequence. It maps sequence characters to their corresponding child nodes, representing the continuation of the sequence.

#### Genome Storage in Graph
Are entire genomes stored in the graph? Or are only the sequences of interest stored? If the latter, how are the sequences of interest identified? Are they identified by their position in the genome? Or are they identified by some other means?
- Only the sequences of interest are stored in the graph. These sequences are identified based on specific criteria such as the presence of particular motifs or functional relevance. The identification can be based on their positions in the genome or other biological markers.

#### Adding a New Sequence to the Graph
Show an example of how a new sequence is added to the graph.
- To add a new sequence "AGC" to the graph, follow these steps:

    ```go
    func AddSequence(root *Node, sequence string) {
        currentNode := root
        
        for _, char := range sequence {
            if _, ok := currentNode.Children[char]; !ok {
                newNode := &Node{
                    Label:      string(char),
                    Occurrences: []int{},
                    Children:   make(map[rune]*Node),
                }
                currentNode.Children[char] = newNode
            }
            currentNode = currentNode.Children[char]
        }
        // Add occurrence position if needed
        // currentNode.Occurrences = append(currentNode.Occurrences, position)
    }

    // Example usage:
    root := &Node{Children: make(map[rune]*Node)}
    AddSequence(root, "AGC")
    ```

### Conclusion
The sequence matching graph structure, with detailed node and edge compositions, a traversal mechanism, and illustrative examples, forms the core of efficient sequence matching. This approach supports both recursive and iterative traversal techniques, ensuring flexibility and clarity in matching input sequences to stored reference sequences.

This documentation integrates theoretical foundations with practical implementation methods to provide a cohesive understanding of sequence-matching graphs in the PromiseGrid system.

### Sequence Matching in the Context of PromiseGrid

#### Breakdown of Sequence Storage and Matching
In a sequence-matching graph, sequences can be broken down into smaller sub-sequences, similar to the concept of hashing. These sub-sequences are stored as paths within the graph. When matching a sequence fragment with unknown leading characters, the following steps are taken:

1. **Decomposition**: The input sequence is broken down into all possible sub-sequences.
2. **Traversal**: The algorithm traverses the graph, starting from various nodes representing potential sub-sequences.
3. **Comparison**: Each potential path is compared against the input sequence fragment to identify matches.

This allows the system to handle sequences even if the leading characters are unknown. By leveraging the graph structure, PromiseGrid can efficiently search and match large datasets, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.

### Handling Unknown Leading Characters in Sequence Matching

To find a sequence fragment when the leading characters are unknown, you can use the following approach:

1. **Segment the Fragment**: Break down the input sequence fragment into smaller overlapping segments.
2. **Search for Segments**: Traverse the graph to identify nodes corresponding to the segments.
3. **Extend Matches**: Extend partial matches by exploring neighboring nodes in the graph until a complete match is found.

This method ensures that even with unknown leading characters, the system can effectively locate and match sequence fragments within the graph.

### Practical Example

Consider a scenario where the input fragment is "CGTA":

1. **Segment**: Break down "CGTA" into "CGT", "GTA".
2. **Search**: Find nodes corresponding to "CGT" and "GTA" in the graph.
3. **Extend**: Extend the matches by exploring adjacent nodes to form the complete sequence.

By following these steps, the PromiseGrid system can efficiently handle and match sequence fragments, even with unknown leading characters, ensuring robust sequence matching capabilities.
