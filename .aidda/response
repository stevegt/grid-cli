# Advanced Discussions on Caching, Promises, and Governance in PromiseGrid

## Caching Strategy in PromiseGrid Kernel

### Key Points from ADVICE.md

   * There **MAY BE** multiple caches, including the built-in cache in the kernel and caches provided by various modules.

### Integration with Modules:

   * The kernel **MUST** treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
   * The kernel **SHOULD** load the built-in cache from embedded resources using Go’s embed feature.
   * The kernel **MAY** use the Origin Private File System (OPFS) for disk file access and **MAY** utilize the afero library to abstract filesystem interactions.

### Cache Structures

#### Multiple Caches:


- There **MAY BE** multiple caches, including the built-in cache in the kernel and caches provided by various modules.
- The kernel **SHOULD** load the built-in cache from embedded resources using Go’s `embed` feature.
- The kernel **MAY** use the Origin Private File System (OPFS) for disk file access and **MAY** utilize the `afero` library to abstract filesystem interactions.

#### Cache Keys:

- The cache key **MUST use** filesystem separators (e.g., `/`) between each key component. Arguments **MUST** be URL-encoded when building the cache key to handle characters such as `/` that are unsafe in file or directory names.
- Example: A cache key might be `promiseHash/moduleHash/arg1/arg2`.

### Unified Interface:

- From the caller's perspective, there **SHALL BE** no difference between a cache lookup and a function call. Both operations **SHALL BE** treated as byte sequence completion operations.  The caller sends a message consisting of a byte sequence, and receives a response message containing the remainder of the sequence.

### Cache and Modules

The kernel MUST treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel MUST consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.

1. **Cache Keys**:
    - cache keys are byte sequences. the cache is a trie.

2. **Consulting Modules as Caches**:
    - Modules act as part of the cache mechanism. On a cache miss, the kernel consults one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
    - The cache lookup function takes multiple arguments: `promiseHash`, `moduleHash`, and zero or more arguments from the caller’s message.
    - If a value isn't in the cache, it's retrieved from the module(s), added to the cache, and returned.

## Sequence Matching

### Example Implementations

Combining decision-making and handling into a single function:


```go
type Module interface {
    ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic for processing message, including acceptance and handling
    // Return a promise message with acceptance and handling results or errors
}
```

Using distinct functions for acceptance and handling:


```go
type Module interface {
    Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
    HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic for accepting or rejecting based on parameters
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    // Implement logic for handling the message after acceptance
}
```

### Conclusion

By integrating promises at every level and implementing a hierarchical syscall tree with caching and acceptance history, PromiseGrid ensures trust, accountability, and efficient message handling in a decentralized governance framework. The simplified message structure and consistent handling of cache and modules contribute to a robust and flexible system.

## Key Points from OPFS Notes

### Placement of Caches:

   * The kernel **MUST** treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
   * The kernel **SHOULD** load the built-in cache from embedded resources using Go’s embed feature.
   * From the caller's perspective, there **SHALL BE** no difference between a cache lookup and a function call. Both operations **SHALL BE** treated as byte sequence completions.

### Network Communications:

**Are network communications always done through modules, or can the kernel do some of that itself?**
Network communications in the PromiseGrid Kernel model are primarily intended to be handled by modules rather than the kernel itself. This design aligns with the microkernel architecture principles, where the kernel provides minimal core functionalities and delegates most tasks, such as network communication, to service modules. The kernel’s role includes managing module execution, handling inter-process communication (IPC), and maintaining security and resource control.

   - Treat modules as integral parts of the caching mechanism. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel queries appropriate modules to retrieve the required data dynamically.
2. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Modules dynamically contribute to the cache, enabling the system to scale and manage data efficiently.

### Treating Sequence Matching as Caching

1. **Idea**:
   - Sequence matching can be integrated with the caching strategy, enhancing performance and scalability.
2. **Synchronization**:
   - Ensure cache synchronization based on sequence matches to improve consistency and reliability.

### Implementation Plan

1. Develop caching mechanisms leveraging PromiseGrid’s byte sequence completion.
2. Treat modules as part of the caching strategy to dynamically handle data.
3. Integrate sequence matching into the cache for optimized performance.

### Conclusion

By integrating caching with sequence matching and leveraging modules as extensions of the cache, PromiseGrid enhances its performance, scalability, and reliability. This approach ensures that data is managed dynamically and efficiently, improving the overall system functionality.

type Module interface {
    Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
    HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic for accepting or rejecting based on parameters
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    // Implement logic for handling the message after acceptance
}
```

## Conclusion

By treating cache handling as sequence matching and leveraging byte sequence completion, PromiseGrid can achieve efficient data management, enhanced performance, and scalability. This approach ensures reliable and dynamic cache operations while integrating module functionality.


## Kernel and Caching Perspectives

### Pros and Cons of Unified Message Structure for Network and IPC

**Pros**:
- **Consistency**: Simplifies message translation and handling across communication channels.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitates seamless module interaction for both interhost and intrahost communications.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces redundancy and parsing logic, enhancing overall efficiency.

**Cons**:
- **Complexity**: Difficult to ensure a unified format is optimal for both network and IPC.
- **Overhead**: Network-specific metadata in IPC messages (or vice versa) might introduce unnecessary overhead.

## Importance of Including Module Hash in Messages for Deterministic Execution and Demand-Driven Deployment of New Code

### Deterministic Execution

Including the module hash in each message ensures the same piece of code executes consistently across nodes. This determinism is critical for maintaining consistency and correctness in distributed systems.

### Content-Addressable Code

Module hashes serve as unique identifiers, enabling the precise location and execution of specific code versions. Even amidst updates, nodes can fetch and use the exact module version specified, fostering backward compatibility and stability.

### Dynamic, Demand-Driven Deployment

By embedding module hashes in messages, the system supports on-demand code deployment. Nodes lacking the required module can dynamically retrieve it, promoting adaptability and seamless updates.

# Network Communications and Unified Message Structures 

### Network Communications

**Question**: Are network communications always done through modules, or can the kernel handle some communications?
- **Answer**: Network communications in PromiseGrid are mainly managed by modules, aligning with microkernel principles. The kernel’s minimal core functionalities focus on inter-process communication and resource management, while delegating most tasks, such as network communication, to service modules.

### Justifying Unified Message Structure 

**Unified Message Structure for Inter-Host and Intra-Host Communications**:
1. **Pros**:
   - **Consistency**: Simplifies the handling of messages across different communication contexts.
   - **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for multiple parsing logics, improving development and operational efficiency.
   - **Interoperability**: Enables seamless transition of communication modes, improving overall system agility.

2. **Cons**:
   - **Complexity**: Aligning a unified structure to suit both network and IPC demands can introduce complexity.
   - **Performance Overhead**: Embedding network-specific metadata in IPC messages (and vice versa) might inflate message sizes with redundant data.

### Example Use Cases 

**Cache Miss Handling**:
1. **Inter-Host**: When a cache miss occurs locally, the module issues a message over the network to retrieve the required data from another node’s cache.
2. **Intra-Host**: For the same miss, the module may query another in-host module through IPC mechanisms, leveraging the unified message structure for ease of communication.

**Module Initialization**:
1. **Inter-Host**: Nodes can broadcast initialization messages with required module hashes to synchronize employed module versions.
2. **Intra-Host**: Modules use the same structure to register capabilities and interact with the kernel dynamically, fostering modular growth with minimal structural change.

### Design Conclusion

Implementing a unified message handling structure for network and IPC communications bolsters system consistency, development simplicity, and dynamic adaptability. By evaluating the trade-offs, PromiseGrid ensures optimized performance while maintaining structural integrity and scalability.

### Dynamic Syscall Table with Ant Routing

#### Kernel’s Dynamic Syscall Tree

1. **Syscall Table and Acceptance History**:
    - The kernel **SHOULD** use a dynamic syscall table to store positive and negative acceptance history for all modules.
    - This table **SHOULD** start empty and be populated during operation as the kernel consults built-in and other modules to handle received messages.
    - The kernel **MUST** route messages to the module whose syscall table key matches the most leading parameters components, optimizing routing and reducing redundant checks.

2. **Dynamic and Optimized Message Routing**:

Imagining a syscall table with ant routing involves:

1. **Hierarchical Syscall Tree**:
   - Hierarchical keys with multiple children nodes representing parameter components.
   - Filter based on whether any module accepts the leading parameters, matches the module hash, and accepts the arguments.

Optimization:

- **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - Cache successful paths and optimize routing based on historical data.
   - Dynamic updates to capabilities and keys for effective syscall routing.

# Module Interaction and Delegation

### Cache and Modules

In PromiseGrid, seamless interaction and delegation:

1. **Role of Modules**:
    - Cache as part of modular design.
    - Delegation with specialized modules ensuring modularity.

2. **Unified Interface**:
    - Cache lookups and function calls as unified byte sequence completion. 

### Acceptance and Promises

#### Pros and Cons of Combined and Separate Functions

**Combined `Accept()` and `HandleMessage()` Functions**:

**Pros**:
- **Simplicity and Consistency**: Combined functions eliminate redundancy.
- **Efficiency**: Reduced checks by merging acceptance and handling.

**Cons**:
- **Complexity**: Combined logic for diverse tasks might introduce complexity.
- **Flexibility**: Separate functions allow for specialized logic.

**Example**:

```go
type Module interface {
    ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Combined evaluation and handling
    return // Result or error
}
```

**Separate `Accept()` and `HandleMessage()` Functions**:

**Pros**:
- **Modularity**: Separate logic enhances flexibility.
- **Efficiency**: Early rejection streamlined without handling.

**Example**:

```go
type Module interface {
    Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
    HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Acceptance logic
    return // Accepted promise
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    // Handling logic
    return // Result or error
}
```

### Conclusion

PromiseGrid emphasizes modular and flexible cache handling through integration with byte sequence completion, dynamic delegation, and optimized routing. The combined and separate function approaches address varied operational needs, ensuring robust, consistent, and efficient message processing. Ultimately, by balancing modular interaction with scalable delegation, putting emphasis on promises and trust, PromiseGrid achieves a robust, scalable, and decentralized system.
