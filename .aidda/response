### Design Notes

Includes detailed notes on the design philosophy and architectural principles guiding PromiseGrid. 

- [Design Overview](./doc/00.md)
- [Discussion Notes](./doc/01.md)

### Module Integration

Discusses strategies for effective module integration, ensuring modular, flexible, and decentralized processing.

- [Cache and Module Handling](./doc/02.md)
- [Advanced Discussions](./doc/03.md)
- [Module Integration Concepts](./doc/04.md)

### Capability Tokens

Details the use and implementation of self-contained capability tokens in PromiseGrid. Tokens manage permissions and identity securely.

- [Capability Tokens and Prior Art](./doc/150-capability-tokens.md)

### Data Flow and Sequence Matching

Explores the techniques of sequence matching, data structures like tries and graphs, and their applications.

- [Introduction to Sequence Matching](./doc/200-sequence.md)
- [Graph or Node-Based Representation](./doc/210-sequence-graph.md)

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Inter-Process Communication is critical for a microkernel architecture, facilitating communication between various modules or components within the PromiseGrid.

- [IPC in PromiseGrid](./doc/320-ipc.md)

### Sequence Graphs

Details on implementing sequence matchers using graph-based structures within PromiseGrid.

- [Sequence Matching Implementation](./doc/220-graph.md)
- [Advanced Sequence Matching Concepts](./doc/221-graph.md)

### Hybrid DHT and Open Market

Combines DHT with an open market system to leverage decentralized storage and lookup efficiency.

- [Hybrid DHT and Market Design](./doc/343-dht.md)
- [Pure Market Design](./doc/344-market.md)

### Persisting the Trie to Disk

Describes various options for persisting the trie data structure to disk within PromiseGrid.

- [Decentralized Trie](./doc/345-dtrie.md)
- [Persistence Strategies](./doc/346-persist.md)
