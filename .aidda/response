The file `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/001-design.md` is most similar to the file `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/002-design.md`. Both files cover the design and core concepts of PromiseGrid, including its decentralized architecture, capability-as-promise model, and the modular approach of non-sandboxed modules. They overlap significantly in terms of outlining the kernel's dynamic syscall tree, cache structures, and handling in PromiseGrid. Additionally, both documents discuss the integration of Church, Turing, and Chomsky's concept of "Accept" in the context of computational theory. While there are differences in some sections and levels of detail, their focus and thematic content are closely aligned, making `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/002-design.md` the most similar to `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/001-design.md`.
