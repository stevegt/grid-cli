# Pure Market Design with Promises, Reputation, and the Decentralized Trie (DTrie)

## Introduction

This document outlines a design concept for a pure market system that operates based on promises, reputation, and the Decentralized Trie (DTrie). The goal is to create a decentralized market for storage and retrieval services where nodes interact directly based on market dynamics, leveraging promises and reputation to ensure reliability and trustworthiness. The DTrie facilitates efficient, distributed storage and retrieval of byte sequences within this market system.

## Core Components

1. **Market Layer**
   - The market layer functions as the primary structure, allowing nodes to trade storage and retrieval services.
   - Nodes offer their storage capacity and bandwidth in exchange for compensation.
   - Market dynamics, such as supply, demand, pricing, and competition, determine the cost and allocation of resources, including data replicas.

2. **Promise Mechanism**
   - Nodes make promises to provide storage and retrieval services under specific terms.
   - Promises include conditions such as duration, capacity, and price.
   - Broken promises negatively impact a node's reputation within the system.

3. **Reputation System**
   - Nodes build and maintain a reputation based on their history of promises and performance.
   - A node’s reputation influences its attractiveness and pricing power in the market.

4. **Decentralized Trie (DTrie)**
   - The DTrie structure facilitates efficient, distributed storage and retrieval of byte sequences.
   - Nodes store and manage sequence patterns in a Trie, enabling fast prefix matching and efficient storage.

## Design Overview

### Market Layer

#### Market Mechanics
- **Supply/Demand Replication:** Nodes MAY voluntarily store and offer copies of high-value data based on market pricing or volume.
- **Storage Offers:** Nodes advertise their available storage capacity. Each offer includes specifics such as price, duration, and conditions.
- **Bidding:** Nodes in need of storage place bids, proposing terms for storing their data. The market matches offers and bids based on compatibility and preferences.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Prices for storage and retrieval services are dynamic, influenced by demand, supply, and competition among nodes.

#### Transactions
- **Promises and Capabilities:** Promises detail the terms of service. Capabilities grant access to the provided services.
- **Broken Promise Accounting:** The system tracks broken promises, which affect a node's reputation. Frequent failures result in lower reputation scores, discouraging poor performance.

## Data Storage and Retrieval

### Storage Process
1. **Identification:** Data to be stored is assigned a unique identifier using a cryptographic hash function.
2. **Market Interaction:** The node seeking storage interacts with the market layer, finding a suitable storage offer.
3. **Promise Formation:** A promise is formed and agreed upon by both parties, outlining the storage terms.
4. **Data Chunking:** If necessary, the data is divided into chunks and distributed to the selected storage nodes as per the promise.
5. **Replication:** The data is replicated across multiple nodes by market forces and/or separate promises to ensure reliability.

### Retrieval Process
1. **Identification:** The key associated with the data is used to locate the data within the network.
2. **Market Interaction:** The node seeking to retrieve the data interacts with the market to find retrieval offers.
3. **Promise Formation:** A retrieval promise is established, specifying the retrieval terms.
4. **Data Transfer:** The data is retrieved from the storage nodes and transferred to the requesting node as per the promise conditions.

## Market Dynamics

### Incentive Structures
- **Quality of Service (QoS):** Nodes are incentivized to provide high-quality storage and retrieval services, reflected in their reputation. Higher reliability and faster access times attract higher prices.
- **Reputation Impact:** Nodes failing to meet their promises face a degradation in their reputation, which discourages poor performance and broken promises.

### Competitive Environment
- **Differentiation:** Nodes can differentiate themselves based on their QoS offerings, such as uptime, speed, and reliability.
- **Reputation Systems:** A robust reputation system tracks the performance and reliability of nodes, influencing their attractiveness and opportunities in the market.

## Security Considerations

### Data Integrity and Privacy
- **Cryptographic Hashing:** Each data chunk is signed with a cryptographic hash to ensure integrity and detect tampering.
- **Encryption:** Data can be encrypted before storage to maintain privacy, with only authorized nodes having access to decryption keys.

### Trust and Verification
- **Decentralized Trust:** The system minimizes the reliance on central authorities, relying instead on cryptographic promises and reputation systems to foster trust.
- **Auditability:** All transactions, promises, and broken promises are logged and auditable to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Transaction Logs

### Storage of Transaction Logs
- **Hashed Blobs:** Transaction logs are stored within the system as hashed blobs, ensuring their integrity, verifiability, and availability throughout the network.

## Decentralized Trie (DTrie)

### Key Features

- **Arbitrary Leaf Storage**: Each node voluntarily stores arbitrary leaves of the trie.
- **Local Decision Making**: The decision of whether to store a leaf is local and depends on both supply/demand observations as well as storage promises made.
- **Log Storage**: Logs are stored in the trie.
- **Transaction Storage**: Accounting transactions are stored in the trie.
- **Trie-based Communication**: Communication is facilitated via the trie.

### Architecture

#### Trie Structure

The DTrie is a distributed data structure where each node can store different parts (leaves or internal nodes) of the trie. The architecture is designed to provide efficient data insertion, deletion, and retrieval while maintaining consistency and redundancy.

#### Node Responsibilities

1. **Voluntary Storage**: Nodes decide autonomously whether to store a particular leaf or node segment. This decision is influenced by:
   - **Supply/Demand**: Nodes may prioritize storing data that is in higher demand or lower supply within the network.
   - **Storage Promises**: Existing promises and commitments may guide the node's storage decisions.

2. **Log Management**: Nodes are responsible for storing logs in the trie to maintain an auditable record of events and actions. These logs may include:
   - System events
   - Transactional logs

3. **Transaction Management**: Accounting transactions are stored in the trie, enabling transparent and verifiable financial interactions between nodes.

4. **Communication**: Nodes communicate through the trie, utilizing its structure for efficient data sharing and retrieval.

### Data Insertion

When new data is inserted into the trie:
1. **Identify Position**: The appropriate position in the trie is identified based on the data's key.
2. **Insert Data**: The data is inserted at the identified location, and the trie is updated accordingly.
3. **Propagate Changes**: Relevant nodes are notified of the changes, ensuring consistency across the decentralized network.

### Data Retrieval

To retrieve data from the trie:
1. **Locate Data**: The trie is traversed from the root to the designated leaf node where the data is stored.
2. **Fetch Data**: The data is fetched from the leaf node and returned to the requesting entity.
3. **Verify Integrity**: Integrity checks are performed to ensure the data has not been tampered with during storage or retrieval.

### Maintaining Consistency

Consistency in the DTrie is maintained through:
1. **Replication**: Critical parts of the trie are replicated across multiple nodes to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: In the case of conflicting updates, predefined rules and consensus mechanisms are employed to resolve conflicts and maintain a consistent state.

## Example Message Flow

Imagine a caller local to Host A asks A's kernel for the completion of a specific byte sequence. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the communication flow:

### Step 1: Host B Advertizes Acceptance for Sequence Completion Requests

First, Host B promises to accept requests for sequence completion, advertizing the prefixes it will accept.

```
Host B: PROMISE with prefixes it will accept for sequence completion
```

### Step 2: Caller Requests Byte Sequence Completion

The caller on Host A initiates a request for a byte sequence starting with `0xDE 0xAD`.

```
Caller -> Host A: Request completion for byte sequence 0xDE 0xAD
```

### Step 3: Host A Searches Local Cache

Host A's kernel checks its local DTrie cache to find a completion for the byte sequence `0xDE 0xAD`. Suppose no matching completion is found in A's local cache.

```
Host A Kernel: Searching local DTrie cache for 0xDE 0xAD
Host A Kernel: No match found in local cache
```

### Step 4: Host A invokes Host B promise

Host A's kernel asks Host B, invoking its promise by sending a request for the sequence completion.

```
Host A -> Host B: INVOKE 0xDE 0xAD
```

### Step 5: Host B Processes the invocation

Host B receives the invocation and searches its local DTrie cache to find a possible completion for the byte sequence `0xDE 0xAD`. Suppose Host B finds the completion byte sequence `0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF`.

```
Host B Kernel: Found completion: 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF in local cache
```

### Step 6: Host B Fulfills the Promise

Host B sends an fulfillment message back to Host A, indicating that it has found the completion for the requested byte sequence.

```
Host B -> Host A: FULFILL 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
```

### Step 7: Host A Receives Completion from Host B

Host A's kernel processes the fulfillment message, retrieves the completion byte sequence, and returns it to the original caller.

```
Host A Kernel: Received FULFILL from Host B with completion 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
Host A Kernel: Returning bytes to caller
Caller <- Host A: Completion for 0xDE 0xAD is 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
```

### Communication Flow Summary

1. **Host B Advertizes**: Host B advertizes the prefixes it will accept for sequence completion.
2. **Caller to Host A Kernel**: Initial request for byte sequence completion.
3. **Host A Kernel**: Searches local cache and finds no match.
4. **Host A to Host B**: Sends INVOKE message for the byte sequence.
5. **Host B Kernel**: Searches local cache and finds the completion.
6. **Host B to Host A**: Sends FULFILL message with the completion.
7. **Host A Kernel to Caller**: Returns the completed byte sequence to the caller.

## Conclusion

The pure market design with promises, reputation, and the Decentralized Trie (DTrie) aims to create a decentralized and dynamic market for storage and retrieval services. By integrating the DTrie structure, the system achieves efficient data handling and communication. Future work will involve refining the economic models, enhancing security mechanisms, and optimizing performance to ensure a robust and reliable market system.
