# Axioms in PromiseGrid

## Definition of "Axiom"

An axiom is a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. In the context of PromiseGrid, axioms define the fundamental principles and assumptions upon which the system is built. These foundational truths guide the design, implementation, and operation of the PromiseGrid framework.

### Example Axioms in PromiseGrid

1. **Decentralization Axiom**:
   - The system must function without reliance on any single centralized control or authority, ensuring distributed ownership and operation.

2. **Promise-Based Interaction Axiom**:
   - All interactions within the system are based on promises. A response to any action or request must itself be a promise.

3. **Content-Addressable Storage Axiom**:
   - Data and code within the system are addressed by their content rather than by their location or name, promoting integrity and consistency.

4. **Modularity Axiom**:
   - The system is composed of modular components that can operate independently, yet coherently, within the framework.
   
5. **Security Axiom**:
   - Security must be an inherent feature of the system, ensuring that all communications and data handling are conducted securely and reliably.

These axioms serve as the guiding principles behind the development and evolution of PromiseGrid, ensuring adherence to its core values and objectives.
