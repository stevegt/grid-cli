# PromiseGrid Layer Structure in an OSI-like Model

PromiseGrid's architecture can be understood through a layered approach, similar to the OSI Model used in traditional networking. Here, we outline the key layers and their functions within the PromiseGrid system.

## Layer Structure

### 1. Physical Layer

**Hardware and Host Layer**: This layer includes the physical or virtual hardware running PromiseGrid. It represents the fundamental resources such as servers, containers, browsers, or virtual machines upon which all higher-level operations depend.

- **Components**:
  - Physical or virtual servers, hardware resources.
  - Containers or virtual machines.
  - WASM-based browsers or clients.
  - Command-line or server applications.

### 2. Data Link Layer

**Link Layer**: Responsible for physical addressing and the reliable transmission of data between nodes.

- **Components**:
  - Long-lived TCP connections between peers.
  - Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as Mach-style ports between modules.

### 3. Network Layer

**Routing Layer**: Manages the dynamic routing and forwarding of messages across the network. It ensures messages are delivered to the appropriate nodes and modules.

- **Components**:
  - Routing mechanisms, ensuring efficient path selection and data forwarding.

### 4. Transport Layer

**Transport Layer**: This layer handles the transfer of packets between hosts and ensures that data is sent and received accurately and in the correct sequence.

- **Components**:
  - Transmission protocols, error detection, and correction mechanisms.

### 5. Session Layer

**Session Layer**: Manages interactive sessions between modules and hosts, including the establishment, management, and termination of communication sessions.

- **Components**:
  - Session management protocols, communication control mechanisms.

### 6. Presentation Layer

**Kernel Layer**: The PromiseGrid Kernel resides here. It manages core system functions such as routing messages, resource management, and enforcing security protocols.

- **Components**:
  - PromiseGrid Kernel processes and modules, ensuring execution and governance.

### 7. Application Layer

**Module Layer**: User-space modules operate at this level, offering various services and applications within the PromiseGrid framework.

- **Components**:
  - User-space modules, application services.

    }

    subgraph cluster_3 {
      label="Transport Layer";

    }

    subgraph cluster_4 {
      label="Network Layer";
      Routing [ label="Dynamic routing\nMessage forwarding" shape=box];
    }

    subgraph cluster_5 {
      label="Data Link Layer";
      LinkLayer [ label="Long-lived TCP\nIPC mechanisms" shape=box];
    }

    subgraph cluster_6 {
      label="Physical Layer";
      Physical [ label="Physical or virtual\nhardware resources" shape=box];
    }

    Modules -> Kernel;
    Kernel -> Session;
    Session -> Transport;
    Transport -> Routing;
    Routing -> LinkLayer;
    LinkLayer -> Physical;
}
```

## Conclusion

The PromiseGrid architecture, when depicted in an OSI-like layered model, provides a clear structure for understanding the discrete functions and responsibilities at each level. This layering helps ensure modularity, scalability, and efficient management of resources and communication within PromiseGrid.
