# PromiseGrid CLI V2 Design

## Overview

The PromiseGrid CLI V2 is designed to be a comprehensive command-line tool facilitating interaction with the PromiseGrid decentralized computing, communications, and governance framework. This document outlines the core design principles, architectural details, and functionality of the CLI.

## Core Concepts

1. **Decentralized Architecture**: PromiseGrid operates without a central authority, allowing users to interact directly with the network. The CLI provides the necessary tools to interface with this decentralized environment effectively.

2. **Capability-as-Promise Model**: The CLI will enable users to manage capabilities as promises. These capabilities can either be fulfilled or revoked, aligning with Promise Theory principles.

3. **Content-addressable Code and Data**: The CLI facilitates access and management of content-addressable code and data, ensuring decentralized storage and retrieval.

4. **Promise-Based Interactions**: Every command and interaction within the CLI is designed to issue and respond to promises, encapsulating the core philosophy of PromiseGrid.

## CLI Features

1. **Module Registration and Management**: The CLI offers commands to register, update, and manage modules within the grid, supporting both explicit registration and hash-based routing mechanisms.

2. **Exchange Rate Routing**: The CLI includes functionality to evaluate and manage exchange rates for personal currencies, impacting routing decisions within the grid.

3. **Message Handling and Nesting**: Users can create, send, and manage nested messages through the CLI, facilitating dynamic and complex interactions.

4. **Content Retrieval**: Support for multihash, multibase, and multicodec ensures that the CLI can retrieve and handle various data formats seamlessly.

## Flexible Design for Module Registration

### Overview

Modules in PromiseGrid interact with the kernel either via explicit registration or through hash-based routing. These methods provide unique benefits:

### Explicit Module Registration

#### Pros
1. **Clarity and Explicitness**: Modules clearly report their capabilities, simplifying system interaction.
2. **Fine-Grained Control**: The kernel enforces rules based on the reported capabilities.
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Modules can dynamically update their capabilities, allowing for on-the-fly changes.

#### Cons
1. **Complexity**: Adds to initialization and management complexity.
2. **Performance Overhead**: The registry maintenance and querying introduce overhead.
3. **Dependency Management**: Changes in capabilities may require system-wide updates, increasing dependency risks.

### Hash-Based Routing

#### Pros
1. **Decentralization**: Does not require a central registry of modules, aligning with the decentralized nature of PromiseGrid.
2. **Scalability**: Easier to scale as nodes independently verify and utilize hashes.
3. **Simplicity**: Reduces complexity by eliminating the need for explicit registration.

#### Cons
1. **Coordination Challenges**: Lacks the clear structure provided by explicit registration, potentially causing coordination challenges.
2. **Security Risks**: More susceptible to hash collisions and other security vulnerabilities.

## Exchange Rate Routing

### Concept

Hosts within the grid route messages based on the exchange rates of personal currencies, where each host issues a form of currency represented by reputation points. These reputation points influence routing decisions, encouraging reliable behavior and network stability.

### How It Works

1. **Currency Evaluation**: Each host evaluates the reputation (currency) of others.
2. **Routing Decisions**: Hosts prefer routes through higher-reputation hosts, ensuring stability.
3. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Exchange rates dynamically adjust based on host behavior and market conditions.

## Messages and Promises

### Messages

Messages in PromiseGrid are byte sequences, meaningful only to the modules and not to the kernel. This generic structure supports modular and extensible communication.

## Multihash, Multibase, and Multicodec

The CLI leverages multihash, multibase, and multicodec to ensure compatibility and extensibility across various data formats, enhancing interoperability within the decentralized system.

## Open Questions

- Determining mechanisms to handle broken promises effectively.
- Best practices for handling and selecting the best routes when multiple handlers are available.

## Conclusion

The PromiseGrid CLI V2 aims to be a versatile and powerful tool for interacting with the PromiseGrid framework, supporting its decentralized, promise-based architecture.

## Suggestions for Improving this Document

- Provide more examples and case studies to illustrate usage.
- Expand on hierarchical syscall tree descriptions.
- Update sections as new questions arise during implementation.
- Refine the glossary with specialized terms and concepts.
- Incorporate visual aids to showcase the system architecture and data flow.
