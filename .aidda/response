The documents most in disagreement or conflict with each other appear to be:

1. **001-design.md vs. 002-design.md**
   - Both documents outline the design principles and core concepts of PromiseGrid but may contain conflicting details or approaches.

2. **003-design.md vs. 010-cache.md vs. 011-cache.md vs. 013-cache.md vs. 014-cache.md**
   - These documents discuss cache and module handling in the PromiseGrid Kernel. They may have overlapping content and possibly conflicting methods or guidelines on cache management and promise handling.

3. **190-side-effects.md vs. 201-computable.md**
   - These documents explore theoretical aspects of PromiseGridâ€™s model, focusing on side effects and computability, potentially leading to differing views on how these principles are applied.

4. **207-vn-guest.md vs. 202-von-neumann.md**
   - Both discuss hosting conventional systems on PromiseGrid but from different perspectives, which might result in conflicting recommendations or methodologies.

### Steps for Resolving Conflicts

1. **Harmonize Design Principles**:
   - Review and align the overarching design principles across 001-design.md and 002-design.md to ensure a cohesive vision.

2. **Consolidate Cache Management Methods**:
   - Merge the cache management strategies from 003-design.md, 010-cache.md, 011-cache.md, 013-cache.md, and 014-cache.md into a unified guide. Address any conflicting methods and settle on a standardized approach.

3. **Align Theoretical Concepts**:
   - Reconcile the theoretical discussions in 190-side-effects.md and 201-computable.md to ensure a consistent interpretation of side effects and computability within the PromiseGrid framework.

4. **Unified Approach for Hosting Systems**:
   - Combine insights from 207-vn-guest.md and 202-von-neumann.md to provide a clear, consistent methodology for hosting conventional systems on PromiseGrid.
