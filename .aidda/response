### Introduction

PromiseGrid synthesizes concepts from genetics, computer science, and mathematics in its design, particularly in its approach to decentralized governance, caching, and modular interactions. [...]

### Embedded Design Notes

Includes detailed notes on the design philosophy and architectural principles guiding PromiseGrid. Each file under `embedded` subdirectory represents a specific aspect of the design.

- [Design Overview](./doc/00.md)
- [Discussion Notes](./doc/01.md)

### Module Integration

Discusses strategies for effective module integration, ensuring modular, flexible, and decentralized processing.

- [Cache and Module Handling](./doc/02.md)
- [Advanced Discussions](./doc/03.md)
- [Module Integration Concepts](./doc/04.md)

### Capability Tokens

Details the use and implementation of self-contained capability tokens in PromiseGrid. Tokens manage permissions and identity securely.

- [Capability Tokens and Prior Art](./doc/150-capability-tokens.md)

### Data Flow and Sequence Matching

Explores the techniques of sequence matching, data structures like tries and graphs, and their applications.

- [Introduction to Sequence Matching](./doc/200-sequence.md)
- [Graph or Node-Based Representation](./doc/210-sequence-graph.md)

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Inter-Process Communication is critical for a microkernel architecture, facilitating communication between various modules or components within the PromiseGrid.

- [IPC in PromiseGrid](./doc/320-ipc.md)

### Sequence Graphs

Details on implementing sequence matchers using graph-based structures within PromiseGrid.

- [Sequence Matching Implementation](./doc/220-graph.md)
- [Advanced Sequence Matching Concepts](./doc/221-graph.md)

### Hybrid DHT and Open Market

Combines DHT with an open market system to leverage decentralized storage and lookup efficiency.

- [Hybrid DHT and Market Design](./doc/343-dht.md)
- [Pure Market Design](./doc/344-market.md)

### Persisting the Trie to Disk

Describes various options for persisting the trie data structure to disk within PromiseGrid.

- [Persistence Strategies](./doc/346-persist.md)

### Advanced Configuration

Detailed advanced setups and configurations for PromiseGrid, focusing on modular, flexible, and decentralized system administration.

- [Dynamic Trie](./doc/345-dtrie.md)

### Treating Lazy-Loading from Disk and Network 

In the PromiseGrid system, lazy-loading a node from disk should be treated the same as lazy-loading a node from a remote host over the network; both are IO-bound operations. 

- In both cases, an in-memory trie miss generates a call via the kernel.
- The kernel handles disk and network I/O.
- The trie code does not import any OPFS or `afero` library; file and network I/O are the responsibility of other microkernel services.

This approach ensures that the trie code remains focused on its primary responsibility—efficiently managing in-memory trie data structures—while delegating I/O operations to dedicated microkernel services. This separation of concerns leads to cleaner, more maintainable code and leverages the existing microkernel services for handling diverse I/O operations.
