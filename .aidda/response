# Communication via the Decentralized Trie (DTrie)

## Introduction

The Decentralized Trie (DTrie) structure facilitates efficient, distributed storage and retrieval of byte sequences. This document paints an illustrative picture of how communication transpires through the DTrie by demonstrating an example message flow. We will follow a caller's request from Host A, the steps taken within Host A's kernel, and the interactions with Host B to complete the request.

## Key Features

- **Arbitrary Leaf Storage**: Each node voluntarily stores arbitrary leaves of the trie.
- **Local Decision Making**: The decision of whether to store a leaf is local and depends on both supply/demand observations as well as storage promises made.
- **Log Storage**: Logs are stored in the trie.
- **Transaction Storage**: Accounting transactions are stored in the trie.
- **Trie-based Communication**: Communication is facilitated via the trie.

## Architecture

### Trie Structure

The dTrie is a distributed data structure where each node can store different parts (leaves or internal nodes) of the trie. The architecture is designed to provide efficient data insertion, deletion, and retrieval while maintaining consistency and redundancy.

### Node Responsibilities

1. **Voluntary Storage**: Nodes decide autonomously whether to store a particular leaf or node segment. This decision is influenced by:
   - **Supply/Demand**: Nodes may prioritize storing data that is in higher demand or lower supply within the network.
   - **Storage Promises**: Existing promises and commitments may guide the node's storage decisions.

2. **Log Management**: Nodes are responsible for storing logs in the trie to maintain an auditable record of events and actions. These logs may include:
   - System events
   - Transactional logs

3. **Transaction Management**: Accounting transactions are stored in the trie, enabling transparent and verifiable financial interactions between nodes.

4. **Communication**: Nodes communicate through the trie, utilizing its structure for efficient data sharing and retrieval.

### Data Insertion

When new data is inserted into the trie:
1. **Identify Position**: The appropriate position in the trie is identified based on the data's key.
2. **Insert Data**: The data is inserted at the identified location, and the trie is updated accordingly.
3. **Propagate Changes**: Relevant nodes are notified of the changes, ensuring consistency across the decentralized network.

### Data Retrieval

To retrieve data from the trie:
1. **Locate Data**: The trie is traversed from the root to the designated leaf node where the data is stored.
2. **Fetch Data**: The data is fetched from the leaf node and returned to the requesting entity.
3. **Verify Integrity**: Integrity checks are performed to ensure the data has not been tampered with during storage or retrieval.

### Maintaining Consistency

Consistency in the dTrie is maintained through:
1. **Replication**: Critical parts of the trie are replicated across multiple nodes to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: In the case of conflicting updates, predefined rules and consensus mechanisms are employed to resolve conflicts and maintain a consistent state.

## Security Considerations

### Data Integrity

Data integrity is ensured through:
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Each node and data entry in the trie is associated with a cryptographic hash, allowing verification of data integrity.
- **Signatures**: Nodes may sign the data they store, providing an additional layer of assurance.

### Privacy

- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted before being inserted into the trie, ensuring that only authorized entities can read the data.
- **Access Control**: Nodes enforce access control policies to regulate who can read or write to specific parts of the trie.

## Conclusion

A decentralized trie is a powerful tool for managing distributed data in the PromiseGrid framework. By allowing nodes to autonomously decide on their storage commitments and by embedding logs, transactions, and communication within the trie, the system achieves a high level of efficiency, scalability, and trustworthiness.

Future improvements may focus on optimizing the trie algorithms for even better performance and exploring additional use cases for dTrie within decentralized applications.

## Example Message Flow

Imagine a caller local to Host A asks A's kernel for the completion of a specific byte sequence. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the communication flow:

### Step 1: Caller Requests Byte Sequence Completion

The caller on Host A initiates a request for a byte sequence starting with `0xDE 0xAD`.

```
Caller -> Host A: Request completion for byte sequence 0xDE 0xAD
```

### Step 2: Host A Searches Local Cache

Host A's kernel checks its local DTrie cache to find a completion for the byte sequence `0xDE 0xAD`. Suppose no matching completion is found in A's local cache.

```
Host A Kernel: Searching local DTrie cache for 0xDE 0xAD
Host A Kernel: No match found in local cache
```

### Step 3: Host A Makes a Promise to Host B

Host A's kernel makes a promise to Host B, asking whether Host B can provide a completion for the byte sequence.

```
Host A -> Host B: PROMISE 0xDE 0xAD
```

### Step 4: Host B Processes the Promise

Host B receives the promise and searches its local DTrie cache to find a possible completion for the byte sequence `0xDE 0xAD`. Suppose Host B finds the completion byte sequence `0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF`.

```
Host B Kernel: Received PROMISE for 0xDE 0xAD
Host B Kernel: Found completion: 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF in local cache
```

### Step 5: Host B Sends Acceptance to Host A

Host B sends an acceptance message back to Host A, indicating that it has found the completion for the requested byte sequence.

```
Host B -> Host A: ACCEPTANCE 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
```

### Step 6: Host A Receives Completion from Host B

Host A's kernel processes the acceptance message, retrieves the completion byte sequence, and returns it to the original caller.

```
Host A Kernel: Received ACCEPTANCE from Host B with completion 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
Host A Kernel: Returning bytes to caller
Caller <- Host A: Completion for 0xDE 0xAD is 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
```

### Communication Flow Summary

1. **Caller to Host A Kernel**: Initial request for byte sequence completion.
2. **Host A Kernel**: Searches local cache and finds no match.
3. **Host A to Host B**: Sends PROMISE message for the byte sequence.
4. **Host B Kernel**: Searches local cache and finds the completion.
5. **Host B to Host A**: Sends ACCEPTANCE message with the completion.
6. **Host A Kernel to Caller**: Returns the completed byte sequence to the caller.

### Promise/Acceptance Message Structure

The promise and acceptance messages follow a specific structure to standardize communication:

- **PROMISE Message**
  - Sender: Host A
  - Recipient: Host B
  - Payload: Byte sequence for which completion is sought, e.g., `0xDE 0xAD`.

- **ACCEPTANCE Message**
  - Sender: Host B
  - Recipient: Host A
  - Payload: Completed byte sequence found in local DTrie, e.g., `0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF`.

## Conclusion

This example clarifies how communication via the DTrie operates, particularly illustrating the interaction between hosts in the network to fulfill a caller's byte sequence completion request. By utilizing promise and acceptance messages, the DTrie structure facilitates efficient, distributed collaboration for data retrieval.
