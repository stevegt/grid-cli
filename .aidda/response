# Infinite State Machines (ISMs) in Sequence Completion for PromiseGrid

## Introduction

In PromiseGrid, an Infinite State Machine (ISM) enables dynamic handling and completion of sequences. Unlike finite state machines, ISMs have an unbounded set of states, offering flexibility in computation and data management. This document discusses ISMs' principles, sequence completion using "what's next" assertions in a graph, and the graph's role as the ISM's execution journal.

### Agent Assertions and Promises

Agents within PromiseGrid make assertions, which are formalized as promises. An assertion signifies a commitment by an agent to perform a specific action or fulfill a particular role within the system. These promises are reciprocated as agents respond to each other's assertions, establishing a network of mutual commitments. When conflicting assertions arise, agents weigh these by leveraging their personal currency values, which reflect their reputation and reliability. This economic weighting ensures that more trusted and reputable agents have their assertions prioritized, maintaining overall system stability and trustworthiness. Unlike traditional function calls, which are often seen as impositions directing an agent to perform a task, assertions are voluntary promises that embody trust and collaboration within the network.

## Understanding Infinite State Machines (ISMs)

### What is an ISM?

An ISM extends finite state machines by allowing unlimited states and transitions. 

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **Unbounded States**: ISMs create and transition to new states as needed.
2. **Dynamic Transitions**: Transitions are determined by events and the current state, enabling adaptive behavior.
3. **Self-Modifying Execution**: ISMs can alter their structure and behavior during execution to handle complex tasks.

### Are ISMs Turing-Equivalent?

ISMs, with their unbounded states and transitions, can be Turing-equivalent, meaning they can perform any computation a Turing machine can, given enough resources.

#### Turing Equivalence:

1. **Unbounded Memory**: ISMs simulate a Turing machine's tape by dynamically creating states.
2. **Conditional Transitions**: Implementing conditional logic allows iterative and recursive computations.
3. **Halting Behavior**: The universe does not halt, but there may need to be a way for an agent to assert "there is no next state".

## Sequence Completion in ISMs

### Implementing Sequence Completion

PromiseGrid uses "what's next" assertions in a graph structure to complete sequences, predicting and executing the next state based on the current state and event.

#### Assertions of "What's Next":

1. **Graph Representation**: sequences are paths in a graph, with nodes as states and edges as transitions.
2. **Dynamic Assertions**: Possible transitions are asserted based on current inputs, guiding completion.
3. **Path Selection**: The most probable path is chosen based on historical data and context for efficient completion.

### ISM Transitions as "What's Next" Predictions

Each ISM transition acts as a "what's next" prediction within the graph structure.

### PromiseGrid as an ISM

PromiseGrid functions as an ISM.

**Design Goal 1: Decentralization – PASS**

- **Explanation**: The design documents describe a decentralized architecture where no single point of control or failure exists. The system operates without centralized authorities, supporting peer-to-peer interactions, distributed data storage, and decentralized governance mechanisms. Documents like `001-design.md` and `002-design.md` emphasize decentralized architecture, content-addressable storage, and decentralized governance.

---

**Design Goal 2: Promise-Based Interaction – PASS**

- **Explanation**: The concept of promises is thoroughly integrated into the system's design. All interactions are based on promises, as detailed in documents like `001-design.md` and `003-design.md`. The design includes consistent handling of promises, mechanisms for managing broken promises, and clear explanations of how promises function within the system.

---

**Design Goal 3: Content-Addressable Storage – PASS**

- **Explanation**: The system uses cryptographic hashes for addressing data and code, enabling content-addressable storage. Documents such as `002-design.md` and `003-design.md` outline how data retrieval and caching mechanisms rely on content hashes. Immutability and data integrity are ensured through the use of these cryptographic methods.

---

**Design Goal 4: Modularity – PASS**

- **Explanation**: The design promotes modularity by allowing independent development and deployment of modules. Interface definitions, interaction protocols, and interoperability standards are specified in documents like `001-design.md` and `320-ipc.md`. The system supports seamless upgrading and extension of modules without disrupting overall operation.

---

**Design Goal 5: Security and Integrity – FAIL**

- **Explanation**: While the design addresses data integrity and access control through cryptographic hashes and capability tokens (as mentioned in `002-design.md` and `150-capability-tokens.md`), it lacks detailed specifications on secure communication protocols. There is an absence of explicit encryption and authentication methods for inter-node communication, leaving a gap in secure communication practices.

---

**Design Goal 6: Scalability and Performance – FAIL**

- **Explanation**: The design supports scalability through decentralization and modularity; however, it lacks specific performance metrics and detailed strategies for performance monitoring and optimization. Documents do not provide benchmarking plans or methods for identifying and addressing potential bottlenecks, which are essential for assessing and ensuring system performance.

---

**Design Goal 7: Transparency and Auditability – FAIL**

- **Explanation**: The design documents do not detail mechanisms for logging actions, events, or transactions. There is no mention of audit trails, access controls for logs, or monitoring tools necessary for transparency and auditability. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess accountability and trace actions within the system.

---

**Design Goal 8: Resilience and Fault Tolerance – FAIL**

- **Explanation**: Although the system's decentralized nature implies some level of resilience, the design lacks explicit mechanisms for failure detection, recovery procedures, and graceful degradation. Documents do not specify how the system handles node or service failures, data replication strategies, or failover processes necessary to ensure continued operation despite failures.

---

**Design Goal 9: Layer Design – PASS**

- **Explanation**: The design documents, particularly `100-layers.md`, clearly define the different layers of the system and their responsibilities. Inter-layer communication is specified, and the layers are designed to operate independently, providing abstraction of underlying complexities. This structured approach aligns with the goals of clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

---

**Design Goal 10: Runtime Simplicity – FAIL**

- **Explanation**: The design does not provide details on the runtime environment's simplicity or usability. There is a lack of information on APIs, documentation clarity, error handling mechanisms, and debugging tools. Without these details, it's challenging to assess whether the runtime offers an easily understandable environment for user-developed agents.

---

**Design Goal 11: Configuration Management – PASS**

- **Explanation**: The system supports configuration management tasks, including container support, VM hosting, and bare-metal integration. Document `207-vn-guest.md` discusses hosting conventional operating systems and applications on PromiseGrid, indicating the ability to manage containers, virtual machines, and physical hardware installations.

---

**Design Goal 12: Orchestration – FAIL**

- **Explanation**: The design lacks details on orchestration capabilities required for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. There is no mention of image management, resource allocation, lifecycle management, or networking specific to container orchestration, which are essential components for this goal.

---

**Summary:**

- **Pass**: Decentralization, Promise-Based Interaction, Content-Addressable Storage, Modularity, Layer Design, Configuration Management.
- **Fail**: Security and Integrity, Scalability and Performance, Transparency and Auditability, Resilience and Fault Tolerance, Runtime Simplicity, Orchestration.

**Overall Assessment:**

The PromiseGrid design documents successfully address core principles such as decentralization, promise-based interaction, content-addressable storage, modularity, layer design, and configuration management. However, there are significant gaps in security details, performance planning, transparency mechanisms, fault tolerance strategies, runtime simplicity, and orchestration capabilities. Addressing these failures is crucial to ensure the system's robustness, security, and usability in real-world applications.
