The files most discussing using channels internally within the kernel are:

1. `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/320-ipc.md`
2. `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/323-syscalls.md`
3. `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/380-kernel.md`

These files cover the intricacies of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) within the PromiseGrid kernel, detailing the internal mechanisms such as channel usage, syscall processing, and overall kernel communications and responsibilities.
