# TODO List for Implementing PromiseGrid Kernel

## General Improvements
- Improve documentation clarity and consistency.
- Resolve internal inconsistencies and discuss any remaining conflicts.
- Add logical statements and recommendations in technical sections.
- Include open-ended questions to provoke further discussion and exploration.

## Documentation Refinements
- Identify and resolve any conflicting information within the documentation.
- Ensure all statements are logical and support the overall system architecture.
- Add recommendations and best practices based on the current design.
- List documents that are most similar and could be merged.

## Detailed Task List
- Review the documentation for:
  - Logical flow and coherence.
  - Consistency in terminology usage.
- Resolve any discrepancies or conflicting ideas.
- Detailed descriptions for some of the strategies and methods mentioned:
  - Implement example-based explanations wherever possible.
  - Provide case studies and visual aids to enhance understanding.

## Cache Design and Lookup
- Refactor the cache design to use byte sequence completion for key management.
  - Remove references to `/`-separated cache keys and transition to byte sequence completion.
  - Document the byte sequence management strategy.
- Reimplement the cache index to handle byte sequences, removing dependencies on filesystem operations for key management.

## Dynamic Acceptance History and Syscall Table
- Revamp the acceptance history mechanism to track byte sequence completions.
  - Store positive and negative sequence completions effectively.
  - Populate acceptance and rejection history dynamically during kernel operations.
  - Implement efficient lookup facilities to match message sequences with handlers based on historical completion success rates.

## Implement Ant Routing Mechanism
- Integrate byte sequence completion with the ant routing mechanism.
  - Adapt the ant routing algorithm to cache successful byte sequence paths.
  - Develop a strategy to dynamically adjust routing based on promise fulfillment statistics.

## Promise-Based Design
- Augment cache and syscall tree design to fully integrate with byte sequence completion as a core mechanism:
  - Rework promise handling to support dynamic sequence completion.
  - Investigate and implement strategies for embedding promise validation within byte sequence matching.

## Polymorphic Handling and Error Detection
- Develop error handling routines specific to byte sequence completion:
  - Enhance the dispatching mechanism to manage failures in byte sequence processing gracefully.
  - Implement retries and alternative handler routing based on sequence fulfillment failures.

## File Storage and Byte Sequences
- Migrate storage mechanisms to manage byte sequences efficiently:
  - Replace traditional file key management with content-addressable byte sequences.
  - Ensure compatibility with Origin Private File System (OPFS) and abstract filesystem integration via libraries like `afero`.

## Usability and Documentation
- Improve the documentation on managing and converting sequences:
  - Create clear usage examples and guidelines for byte sequence management.
  - Provide concise guides for converting from legacy filesystem-based cache management to byte sequence completion.

## Review and Refactor
- Conduct a comprehensive review to identify legacy points where `/`-separated cache key handling still exists:
  - Complete refactoring of these sections to support byte sequence completion.
  - Validate the correctness and performance of new implementations in various scenarios.

## Security and Verification
- Assess security implications of new byte sequence completion strategies:
  - Ensure that new designs for caching and syscall mechanisms do not introduce vulnerabilities.
  - Enhance the validation and verification processes to assert the integrity of sequence handling mechanisms.

## The documents most in disagreement or conflict with each other appear to be:

1. **001-design.md vs. 002-design.md**
   - Both documents outline the design principles and core concepts of PromiseGrid but may contain conflicting details or approaches:
     - **001-design.md** emphasizes a more detailed and structured approach to the core concepts, including the functionality of non-sandboxed modules, capability-as-promise model, and acceptance history.
     - **002-design.md** provides a broader overview of the same concepts with a slightly different emphasis on explicit module registration and hash-based routing without as much detail on the execution of these concepts.
     - **Potential Conflicts**:
       - **Module Registration**: Differences in the preference for explicit module registration (001-design.md) vs. hash-based routing (002-design.md).
       - **Cache and Promise Handling**: Specific implementation details on how caches handle promises and dynamic adaptation may differ between the documents.
       - **Role of Non-Sandboxed Modules**: 001-design.md provides more specific analogies compared to 002-design.md's generalized approach.

2. **003-design.md vs. 010-cache.md vs. 011-cache.md vs. 013-cache.md vs. 014-cache.md**
   - These documents discuss cache and module handling in the PromiseGrid Kernel. They may have overlapping content and possibly conflicting methods or guidelines on cache management and promise handling:
     - **Cache Indexing**: Different approaches to indexing and managing the cache.
     - **Byte Sequence Management**: Handling byte sequences in cache operations may be inconsistently addressed.

3. **190-side-effects.md vs. 201-computable.md**
   - These documents explore theoretical aspects of PromiseGrid’s model, focusing on side effects and computability, potentially leading to differing views on how these principles are applied:
     - **Theoretical Discussions**: Possible divergence in how side effects are integrated with the overall model and the applicability of computability concepts to byte sequence completion.

4. **207-vn-guest.md vs. 202-von-neumann.md**
   - Both discuss hosting conventional systems on PromiseGrid but from different perspectives, which might result in conflicting recommendations or methodologies:
     - **Integration Methods**: Potentially different approaches for integrating traditional systems into PromiseGrid.
     - **Compatibility Issues**: Differing views on handling compatibility and adapting conventional systems to PromiseGrid’s architecture.

### Steps for Resolving Conflicts

1. **Harmonize Design Principles**:
   - Review and align the overarching design principles across 001-design.md and 002-design.md to ensure a cohesive vision.

2. **Consolidate Cache Management Methods**:
   - Merge the cache management strategies from 003-design.md, 010-cache.md, 011-cache.md, 013-cache.md, and 014-cache.md into a unified guide. Address any conflicting methods and settle on a standardized approach.

3. **Align Theoretical Concepts**:
   - Reconcile the theoretical discussions in 190-side-effects.md and 201-computable.md to ensure a consistent interpretation of side effects and computability within the PromiseGrid framework.

4. **Unified Approach for Hosting Systems**:
   - Combine insights from 207-vn-guest.md and 202-von-neumann.md to provide a clear, consistent methodology for hosting conventional systems on PromiseGrid.

### Merging Similar Documents

To reduce redundancy and potential conflicts, consider merging the following documents:

1. **001-design.md and 002-design.md** into a single comprehensive design guide.
2. **003-design.md, 010-cache.md, 011-cache.md, 013-cache.md, and 014-cache.md** into a unified cache and module handling guide.
3. **190-side-effects.md and 201-computable.md** into a cohesive theoretical framework document.
4. **207-vn-guest.md and 202-von-neumann.md** into a comprehensive guide for hosting conventional systems on PromiseGrid.
