# Axioms 

## Definition of "Axiom"

An axiom is a statement or proposition regarded as established, accepted, or self-evidently true. In PromiseGrid, axioms define the fundamental principles guiding the system's design, implementation, and operation.

### Axioms on which PromiseGrid is based

#### Side Effects

- External observers experience state changes when observing a function call's results.
- A function call always has side effects from the perspective of external observers.
- The system cannot fully know all side effects due to the existence of external observers.

#### Computability

- The observable universe consists of approximately 10^80 atoms, rounded to about 2^270 bits.
- Any data stored at an atomic scale can be addressed by a byte sequence of approximately 2^270 bits.
- Computable data can be addressed using a byte sequence representing the algorithm and its input data (referential transparency).
- Cryptographic hashes can be used to reference algorithms and their data.
- Cryptographic hashes should be collision-resistant and able to be replaced by more secure algorithms as needed.
- Replaceable cryptographic hashes of 2^270 bits or more can reference any atomic-scale data or computable function in the observable universe, constrained by the halting problem.

#### Byte Sequence Completion as a Universal Computation Model

- Byte sequences represent any computable algorithm or data.
- Completing a byte sequence is equivalent to executing a function with its input data.
- Bytes can signal the type, protocol, algorithm, machine, or other prerequisites for completing the sequence.
- Systems interpret leading bytes and route sequences to appropriate subsystems for completion.
- If no subsystem is available to complete a byte sequence, the sequence itself represents a promise of future completion.
- Available subsystems fulfilling the promise are limited by the halting problem.
- Systems completing byte sequences can represent any computable algorithm or data, constrained by the halting problem and available subsystems.

#### Considerations

- Implementing byte-sequence completion on conventional hardware introduces complexity.
- Performance overheads can result from sequence matching, dynamic routing, and resource management.
- Efficient resource management, algorithm selection, concurrency, and caching strategies are essential to optimize performance.

#### Open Questions

- How can PromiseGrid handle performance overheads from the byte-sequence completion model?
- What strategies manage memory and computational costs in sequence matching and routing effectively?
- How can adaptive mechanisms adjust sequence matching strategies based on data patterns?
