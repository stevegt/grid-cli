# Axioms 

## Definition of "Axiom"

An axiom is a statement or proposition regarded as established, accepted, or self-evidently true. In PromiseGrid, axioms define the fundamental principles guiding the system's design, implementation, and operation.

### Axioms on which PromiseGrid is based

#### Side effects

- External observers experience state changes when observing a function call's results.
- All externally observed function calls have side effects.
- A system cannot fully know all side effects due to the existence of external observers.
- Side effects are never fully known.

#### Computability

- Approximately 2^270 bits are needed to address atomic-scale data in the observable universe.
- Computable data can be addressed by a byte sequence referencing the algorithm and its input data (referential transparency).
- Cryptographic hashes can reference algorithms/data and are collision-resistant but replaceable as needed.
- A system with 2^270-bit cryptographic hashes can reference any atomic-scale data or computable function, limited by the halting problem.

#### Byte Sequence Completion as a Universal Computation Model

- Byte sequences represent any computable algorithm or data.
- Completing a byte sequence is equivalent to executing a function with its input data.
- Leading bytes in a sequence can signal computation requirements for completion.
- Byte sequences can represent promises of future completion if subsystems are unavailable.
- A system completing byte sequences can represent any computable algorithm or data, limited by the halting problem and available subsystems.

#### Considerations

Implementing the byte-sequence completion model, especially on conventional hardware, introduces complexity. Performance overheads, such as latency and scalability issues, arise from sequence matching, dynamic routing, and resource management. Efficient resource management, algorithm selection, concurrency, and caching strategies are crucial for optimization.

#### Open Questions

- How can PromiseGrid handle performance overheads from the byte-sequence completion model?
- What strategies best manage memory and computational costs in sequence matching and routing?
- How can adaptive mechanisms adjust sequence matching strategies based on data patterns?
- What concurrency models and caching strategies mitigate latency and scalability issues in the byte-sequence completion model?
