## Capability Tokens and Encoding

### Encoding Capability Tokens in Compressed Formats

Capability tokens can indeed be encoded in compressed formats such as base58. Encoding capability tokens in such formats can make them more compact and easier to handle, especially in contexts where string length is a constraint or where human readability is desired. The Multiformats project provides several libraries that support different encoding formats, including base58. Similarly, the multibase and multihash libraries offer comprehensive solutions for encoding and addressing using various bases and hashing algorithms.

To leverage these libraries:

1. **Multibase**: Multibase is a standard for representing base-encoded binary with a prefix indicating the encoding. It allows for seamless interoperability by distinguishing between base encodings.

2. **Multihash**: Multihash is a protocol for differentiating outputs from various well-established cryptographic hash functions. It ensures that the length and type of the hash functions used are self-describable within the hash value itself, enhancing compatibility across different systems.

Both libraries can be used to encode capability tokens securely and efficiently, facilitating distribution across diverse systems and ensuring robustness in handling.

### Libraries Support

- **Multibase and Multihash**: Available libraries support encoding and decoding using multiple formats and cryptographic hash functions. These include libraries for various programming languages such as Go, JavaScript, Python, and more.
- **Base58**: Specifically, for base58 encoding, libraries like go-multibase (for Go) support the base58 encoding format among others, providing a versatile and easy-to-use API for conversion.

By utilizing these libraries, you can ensure that your capability tokens are not only compact but also maintain their integrity and security across different environments.
