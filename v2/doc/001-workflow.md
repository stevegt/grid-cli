## Enhancing Your Workflow for Book Creation Using Aidda

When writing a technical book, transforming markdown files into a readable, well-structured book involves several tasks, including merging similar files, removing redundant ones, detecting and resolving conflicting information, and reordering files for better flow. Here are some recommendations and workflow enhancements to help you achieve these goals:

### Recommendations for Optimizing Your Workflow

#### 1. Extend Aidda for Initial Processing
- **Merge and De-duplication:**
  Customize Aidda to merge similar files based on content similarity using text matching algorithms.
- **Conflict Detection:**
  Implement basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques within Aidda to flag conflicting information.
- **File Reordering:**
  Enable Aidda to reorder the files intelligently based on keywords, heading analysis, or semantic content analysis.

#### 2. Enhance Aidda with Advanced AI Capabilities
- **Embedding Models:**
  Integrate sentence embedding models like BERT to understand the context of your markdown files. This enhances merging and conflict resolution.
- **Contextual Reordering:**
  Train Aidda to understand the logical flow for your book's content using a sample dataset.

#### 3. Post-processing and Manual Review
- **Manual Review:**
  Perform a thorough manual review of AI-suggested merges and conflict resolutions to ensure content correctness.
- **Flow Adjustment:**
  Adjust file order and structure as needed based on Aidda's automated suggestions.

### Example Enhanced Workflow with Aidda
Hereâ€™s an example workflow to enhance Aidda for aligning with your goals:

#### Initial Data Gathering
- Gather all markdown files from your directory and load them into memory.

#### Content Analysis and Clustering
- Use an embedding model (like BERT) to convert the text of each markdown file into embeddings.
- Perform clustering on these embeddings to group similar files.

#### Merging and De-duplication
- Merge files within each cluster by concatenating their content.
- Remove redundant sections by identifying and eliminating identical or highly similar paragraphs.

#### Conflict Detection
- Use NLP techniques to identify conflicting statements and flag these for manual review.

#### Reordering Files
- Utilize semantic analysis to determine the most logical order for the content.
- Optionally define an outline that the reordering algorithm can follow.

#### Output Generation
- Generate the final markdown file(s) based on reordered and merged content.

#### Manual Review and Editing
- Manually review the generated file(s) to ensure coherence and correctness.
- Make necessary adjustments to the content and structure.

### Example Code for Enhanced Aidda in Python

Below is a code snippet to illustrate the merging and de-duplication step using Python:

```python
import os
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Load all markdown files into memory
def load_markdown_files(directory):
    files = []
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith('.md'):
            with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), 'r') as file:
                files.append(file.read())
    return files

# Generate embeddings for each file using a BERT model
def generate_embeddings(files):
    model = SentenceTransformer('bert-base-nli-mean-tokens')
    embeddings = model.encode(files, convert_to_tensor=True)
    return embeddings

# Cluster similar files together
def cluster_files(embeddings, num_clusters):
    clustering_model = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters)
    clustering_model.fit(embeddings)
    return clustering_model.labels_

# Merge files within each cluster
def merge_files(files, labels):
    cluster_map = {}
    for i, label in enumerate(labels):
        if label not in cluster_map:
            cluster_map[label] = []
        cluster_map[label].append(files[i])
    merged_files = ['\n'.join(cluster_map[label]) for label in cluster_map]
    return merged_files

# Main function to orchestrate the process
def process_markdown_files(directory, num_clusters=5):
    files = load_markdown_files(directory)
    embeddings = generate_embeddings(files)
    labels = cluster_files(embeddings, num_clusters)
    merged_files = merge_files(files, labels)
    return merged_files

# Example execution
directory_path = '/home/stevegt/lab/grid-cli/v2/doc/'
merged_files = process_markdown_files(directory_path)

# Save merged files (optional)
for i, content in enumerate(merged_files):
    with open(f'{directory_path}/merged_{i+1}.md', 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)
```

### Best Practices for Improving Your Workflow
1. **Iterative Refinement:**
   Continuously refine the AI models based on feedback from manual reviews to improve accuracy.
2. **Transparency:**
   Maintain a detailed log of all changes made by the AI for traceability and review.
3. **User Interaction:**
   Allow user interaction at key workflow points, such as during conflict resolution and significant merges.

By following these enhanced workflows and best practices, you can streamline the process of turning markdown files into a cohesive, well-organized book.
