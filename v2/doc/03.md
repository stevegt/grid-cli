# Advanced Discussions on Caching, Promises, and Governance in PromiseGrid

## Caching Strategy in PromiseGrid Kernel

### Key Points from ADVICE.md

1. **Cache Structures**:
   * The cache **SHOULD BE** a directory tree rather than an in-memory map.
   * Cache keys **MUST** use filesystem separators (`/`) between each key component and arguments **MUST** be URL-encoded when building the cache key, in order to safely handle characters in file or directory names.
   * There **MAY BE** multiple caches, including the built-in cache in the kernel and caches provided by various modules.

2. **Integration with Modules**:
   * The kernel **MUST** treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
   * The kernel **SHOULD** load the built-in cache from embedded resources using Go’s embed feature.
   * The kernel **MAY** use the Origin Private File System (OPFS) for disk file access and **MAY** utilize the afero library to abstract filesystem interactions.

3. **Unified Interface**:
   * From the caller's perspective, there **SHALL BE** no difference between a cache lookup and a function call. Both operations **SHALL BE** treated as hashed function calls. The caller sends a message with a leading hash and any arguments and receives a message containing the requested content.

### Kernel and Caching Perspectives

**Does the kernel have its own cache, or does it always rely on one or more modules for caching?**
The kernel **SHOULD** maintain its own cache but **MUST** also treat modules as part of the caching mechanism. When the kernel encounters a cache miss, it **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value. This approach allows for a distributed and scalable caching solution where multiple modules can contribute to the cache.

### Network Communications

**Are network communications always done through modules, or can the kernel do some of that itself?**
Network communications in the PromiseGrid Kernel model are primarily intended to be handled by modules rather than the kernel itself. This design aligns with the microkernel architecture principles, where the kernel provides minimal core functionalities and delegates most tasks, such as network communication, to service modules. The kernel’s role includes managing module execution, handling inter-process communication (IPC), and maintaining security and resource control.

### Capability Tokens and Encoding

Several systems and frameworks implement self-contained capability tokens:

1. **Macaroons**: These are flexible authorization credentials that support delegation and attenuation. A macaroon is a bearer token that can encapsulate permissions and is augmented with caveats, which are conditions that must be satisfied for the macaroon to be considered valid.
2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: JWTs are widely used in web applications to assert claims between parties. They can include custom claims to specify permissions and the intended audience. A JWT can be signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
3. **Caveats in Capability-Based Systems**: Traditional capability-based security systems sometimes support a form of caveats or restrictions within the tokens themselves to specify the scope of permissions and the authorized user.

### Discussion on the Leading Hash in Messages

In the PromiseGrid Kernel, messages MAY start with a promise hash followed by a module hash, and then additional arguments. This structure allows receivers to filter messages based on promises they are willing to accept and route the message to the appropriate module. Here are the pros and cons of the promise hash coming first:

**Pros:**
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Placing the promise hash first allows modules and nodes to quickly filter messages based on the promises they accept.
- **Trust and Governance**: This aligns with decentralized governance. Nodes can establish trust relationships by agreeing on specific promises they will accept.
- **Modular Routing**: Early identification of the promise allows the kernel to route messages to the appropriate module, ensuring efficient distributed handling.

**Cons:**
- **Complexity in Parsing**: Parsing multiple hashes increases the complexity of message handling.
- **Overhead**: Including multiple hashes adds overhead to message size, though this is generally offset by the efficiency gains in routing and filtering.

### Kernel's Dynamic Handling of Accept and HandleMessage

Implementing an advanced interaction model involves considering different versions of function handling of messages. There are two possible structures: combined functions or separate functions.

### Combined Function:

```go
type Module interface {
    ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic to process message, which includes accepting and handling
    // Return a promise message with acceptance and handling results or errors
}
```

### Separate Functions:

```go
type Module interface {
    Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
    HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic to accept or reject based on parms
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    // Implement logic to handle the message following acceptance
}
```

### Conclusion

By integrating promises at every level and implementing a hierarchical syscall tree with caching and acceptance history, PromiseGrid ensures trust, accountability, and efficient message handling in a decentralized governance framework. The simplified message structure and consistent handling of cache and modules contribute to a robust and flexible system.
