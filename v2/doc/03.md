# Advanced Discussions on Caching, Promises, and Governance in PromiseGrid

## Caching Strategy in PromiseGrid Kernel

### Key Points from ADVICE.md

1. **Cache Structures**:
   * The cache **SHOULD BE** a directory tree rather than an in-memory map.
   * Cache keys **MUST** use filesystem separators (`/`) between each key component and arguments **MUST** be URL-encoded when building the cache key, in order to safely handle characters in file or directory names.
   * There **MAY BE** multiple caches, including the built-in cache in the kernel and caches provided by various modules.

2. **Integration with Modules**:
   * The kernel **MUST** treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
   * The kernel **SHOULD** load the built-in cache from embedded resources using Go’s embed feature.
   * The kernel **MAY** use the Origin Private File System (OPFS) for disk file access and **MAY** utilize the afero library to abstract filesystem interactions.

3. **Unified Interface**:
   * From the caller's perspective, there **SHALL BE** no difference between a cache lookup and a function call. Both operations **SHALL BE** treated as hashed function calls. The caller sends a message with a leading hash and any arguments and receives a message containing the requested content.

### Kernel and Caching Perspectives

**Does the kernel have its own cache, or does it always rely on one or more modules for caching?**
The kernel **SHOULD** maintain its own cache but **MUST** also treat modules as part of the caching mechanism. When the kernel encounters a cache miss, it **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value. This approach allows for a distributed and scalable caching solution where multiple modules can contribute to the cache.

### Network Communications

**Are network communications always done through modules, or can the kernel do some of that itself?**
Network communications in the PromiseGrid Kernel model are primarily intended to be handled by modules rather than the kernel itself. This design aligns with the microkernel architecture principles, where the kernel provides minimal core functionalities and delegates most tasks, such as network communication, to service modules. The kernel’s role includes managing module execution, handling inter-process communication (IPC), and maintaining security and resource control.

### Capability Tokens and Encoding

Several systems and frameworks implement self-contained capability tokens:

1. **Macaroons**: These are flexible authorization credentials that support delegation and attenuation. A macaroon is a bearer token that can encapsulate permissions and is augmented with caveats, which are conditions that must be satisfied for the macaroon to be considered valid.
2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: JWTs are widely used in web applications to assert claims between parties. They can include custom claims to specify permissions and the intended audience. A JWT can be signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
3. **Caveats in Capability-Based Systems**: Traditional capability-based security systems sometimes support a form of caveats or restrictions within the tokens themselves to specify the scope of permissions and the authorized user.

### Discussion on the Leading Hash in Messages

In the PromiseGrid Kernel, messages MAY start with a promise hash followed by a module hash, and then additional arguments. This structure allows receivers to filter messages based on promises they are willing to accept and route the message to the appropriate module. Here are the pros and cons of the promise hash coming first:

**Pros:**
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Placing the promise hash first allows modules and nodes to quickly filter messages based on the promises they accept.
- **Trust and Governance**: This aligns with decentralized governance. Nodes can establish trust relationships by agreeing on specific promises they will accept.
- **Modular Routing**: Early identification of the promise allows the kernel to route messages to the appropriate module, ensuring efficient distributed handling.

**Cons:**
- **Complexity in Parsing**: Parsing multiple hashes increases the complexity of message handling.
- **Overhead**: Including multiple hashes adds overhead to message size, though this is generally offset by the efficiency gains in routing and filtering.

## Cache and Module Handling in the PromiseGrid Kernel

PromiseGrid uses a directory tree structure rather than an in-memory map for cache organization. Cache keys use filesystem separators (`/`) and URL-encoded arguments to handle special characters safely.

### Treating Modules as Caches

Modules are treated as part of the caching mechanism. On a cache miss, the kernel consults one or more modules to retrieve the requested value dynamically. This unified interface ensures no difference between a cache lookup and a function call from the caller's perspective.

### The Concept of Acceptance

1. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Modules **MUST** define acceptance criteria for promises, module hashes, and arguments into a single function, `Accept()`.
   - By returning a promise message from `Accept` instead of a boolean, modules provide additional guarantees and meta-information.

2. **Promises as Acceptance**:
   - The `Accept` function returns a promise message. If `HandleMessage` fails, it's considered a broken promise.

### Kernel’s Dynamic Syscall Tree

Acceptance history should be integrated into a dynamic syscall tree, using hierarchical keys to optimize routing based on leading parameters. This tree stores acceptance and rejection history, reducing redundant checks by leveraging the "ant routing" mechanism.

### Combining Accept and HandleMessage Functions

**Pros of Combined Function:**
- **Simplicity**: Combines decision-making and handling.
- **Consistency**: Tightly couples acceptance and handling, reducing logic duplication.
- **Efficiency**: Eliminates redundant checks.

**Pros of Separate Functions:**
- **Clarity**: Separates decision-making and handling logic.
- **Early Rejection**: Quickly rejects messages without handling.
- **Modular Logic**: Specialized acceptance and handling logic.

### Conclusion

By integrating promises at every level and implementing a hierarchical syscall tree with caching and acceptance history, PromiseGrid ensures trust, accountability, and efficient message handling in a decentralized governance framework. The simplified message structure and consistent handling of cache and modules contribute to a robust and flexible system.

### Integrated Summary

- **Key Points from ADVICE.md**: Discussed the cache strategy including multiple caches, unified interface, kernel's caching responsibilities, capability tokens, and hashing mechanisms.
- **Key Points from DISCUSS.md**: Focused on treating modules as caches, promise-based acceptance criteria, integration with Church, Turing, and Chomsky's "accept" concept, and combining accept/handle functions.

## Discussion Integration with Church, Turing, and Chomsky's Accept Concept

### Kernel's Dynamic Handling of Accept and HandleMessage

Implementing a dynamic syscall table with ant routing involves:
1. **Hierarchical Syscall Tree**: Each node in the tree can have multiple children representing different parameter components.
2. **Caching Successful Paths**: Cache successful paths to optimize future routing based on leading parameter sequences.
3. **Populating During Operation**: The syscall tree starts empty and is populated during operation as modules accept and handle messages.

### Unified Message Example

```go
type Module interface {
    ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic to process message, including accepting and handling
}
```

By integrating promises at every level and implementing a hierarchical syscall tree with caching and acceptance history, PromiseGrid ensures trust, accountability, and efficient message handling in a decentralized governance framework.

## TODO: Future Enhancements

1. **Develop Comprehensive Error Handling**: Ensure system robustness by tracking and logging broken promises.
2. **Expand Acceptance Criteria**: Enhance the acceptance criteria to adapt dynamically to changing conditions.
3. **Implement Visual Aids**: Incorporate diagrams and flowcharts to enhance understanding of system architecture and data flow.
4. **Refine Glossary**: Update and expand the glossary to include more specialized terms and concepts as they arise.
