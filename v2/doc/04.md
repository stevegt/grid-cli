# Module Integration and Advanced Concepts

## Advanced Discussions

This document consolidates advanced discussions from previous versions and integrates key learnings, strategies, and design considerations.

### Cache and Modules

The kernel MUST treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel MUST consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.

1. **Cache Keys**:
    - The cache key MUST use filesystem separators (e.g., `/`) between each key component. Arguments MUST be URL-encoded when building the cache key to handle characters such as `/` that are unsafe in file or directory names.
    - Example: A cache key might be `promiseHash/moduleHash/arg1/arg2`.

2. **Consulting Modules as Caches**:
    - Modules act as part of the cache mechanism. On a cache miss, the kernel consults one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
    - The cache lookup function takes multiple arguments: `promiseHash`, `moduleHash`, and zero or more arguments from the caller’s message.
    - If a value isn't in the cache, it's retrieved from the module(s), added to the cache, and returned.

#### Cache Structures
- The cache **SHOULD BE** a directory tree rather than an in-memory map.
- Cache keys **MUST** use filesystem separators (`/`) between each key component and arguments **MUST** be URL-encoded when building the cache key, in order to safely handle characters in file or directory names.
- There **MAY BE** multiple caches, including the built-in cache in the kernel and caches provided by various modules.
  
#### Integration with Modules
- The kernel **MUST** treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
- The kernel **SHOULD** load the built-in cache from embedded resources using Go’s embed feature.
- The kernel **MAY** use the Origin Private File System (OPFS) for disk file access and **MAY** utilize the afero library to abstract filesystem interactions.

#### Unified Interface
- From the caller's perspective, there **SHALL BE** no difference between a cache lookup and a function call. Both operations **SHALL BE** treated as hashed function calls. The caller sends a message with a leading hash and any arguments and receives a message containing the requested content.

#### Kernel and Caching
- The kernel **SHOULD** maintain its own cache but **MUST** also treat modules as part of the caching mechanism. When the kernel encounters a cache miss, it **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value. This approach allows for a distributed and scalable caching solution where multiple modules can contribute to the cache.

#### Network Communications
- Network communications in the PromiseGrid Kernel model are primarily intended to be handled by modules rather than the kernel itself. This design aligns with the microkernel architecture principles, where the kernel provides minimal core functionalities and delegates most tasks, such as network communication, to service modules. The kernel’s role includes managing module execution, handling inter-process communication (IPC), and maintaining security and resource control.

### Ant Routing Mechanism: The Syscall Tree

The syscall tree acts like an "ant routing" mechanism:

1. **Hierarchy and Routing**:
    - The syscall tree uses hierarchical keys. Each node in the tree represents a level of parameter matching.
    - On a cache miss, the kernel routes the message to the module whose syscall tree key matches the most leading parameter components.
    - Example: If no exact match exists for `promiseHash/moduleHash/arg1/arg2`, but a node matches `promiseHash/moduleHash/arg1`, the kernel routes the message through that path.
  
2. **Acceptance as a Promise**:
    - Modules define an `Accept()` function that encompasses the acceptance criteria for promises, module hashes, and arguments.
    - The response from an `Accept()` call is considered a promise. If `HandleMessage()` fails after acceptance, it is considered a broken promise.

### Integration with Church, Turing, and Chomsky's Concept of "Accept"

1. **Computational Theory**:
    - Aligning acceptance with the concepts used by Church, Turing, and Chomsky. In computational theory, a machine or automaton accepts an input if it transitions into an accepting state.
    - Similarly, in PromiseGrid, modules act as recognizers or acceptors based on the promise hash, module hash, and arguments.

2. **Promises All the Way Down**:
    - The entire system leverages promises for each interaction layer. Acceptance and fulfillment of promises are managed consistently across modules, the syscall tree, and the kernel.

### Dynamic Syscall Table

The dynamic syscall table maintains positive and negative acceptance history:

1. **Populating the Syscall Table**:
    - The syscall table starts empty and populates during operation.
    - As the kernel consults built-in and other modules to handle messages, it updates the table based on which modules accept or reject specific parameter sets.

2. **Optimized Routing**:
    - On receiving a message, the kernel consults the syscall table to determine which modules to consult, optimizing message handling and reducing redundant checks.

### Example Implementations

#### Combined Function Approach

Combining decision-making and handling into a single function:

```go
type Module interface {
    ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic for processing message, including acceptance and handling
    // Return a promise message with acceptance and handling results or errors
}
```

#### Separate Functions Approach

Using distinct functions for acceptance and handling:

```go
type Module interface {
    Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
    HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic for accepting or rejecting based on parameters
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    // Implement logic for handling the message after acceptance
}
```

### Conclusion

By integrating promises at all levels and employing a hierarchical syscall tree with caching and acceptance history, PromiseGrid ensures trust, accountability, and efficient message handling. This structure supports a decentralized governance framework, robust system interactions, and reliable module functionality.

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in URLs

When it comes to encoding JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for use in URLs, there's a standard format that is widely accepted. JWTs are typically encoded using Base64url, which is a URL-safe variant of Base64 encoding.

#### Why Base64url?

1. **URL-safe**: Base64url encoding replaces characters that are not URL-safe (such as `+`, `/`, and `=`) with URL-safe alternatives (`-`, `_`, and no padding). This ensures that the token can be safely included in a URL without requiring additional encoding.
2. **Human-readable**: While not as compact as some other encodings (like base58), Base64url maintains a balance between human readability and URL safety.
3. **Standardized**: The use of Base64url for JWTs is specified in the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification (RFC 7519). This standardization means that the approach is widely supported and understood, making it interoperable across different systems and libraries.

#### Encoding Steps

1. **Header and Payload**: The JWT consists of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature. Each part is encoded separately using Base64url.
2. **Concatenation**: The three parts are concatenated together with periods (`.`) as separators. This forms the final JWT string that can be included in a URL.

#### Example

Suppose you have the following JWT:
```json
{
  "header": {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  },
  "payload": {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "iat": 1516239022
  },
  "signature": "SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
}
```

The encoded JWT would look something like this:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

This encoded JWT can be safely used as a URL parameter without further encoding.

Using the standard Base64url encoding for JWTs in URLs ensures compatibility with existing libraries and tools, making it a reliable choice for encoding JWT tokens for use in web applications.

### Capability Tokens and Encoding

Several systems and frameworks implement self-contained capability tokens:

1. **Macaroons**: These are flexible authorization credentials that support delegation and attenuation. A macaroon is a bearer token that can encapsulate permissions and is augmented with caveats, which are conditions that must be satisfied for the macaroon to be considered valid.
2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: JWTs are widely used in web applications to assert claims between parties. They can include custom claims to specify permissions and the intended audience. A JWT can be signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
3. **Caveats in Capability-Based Systems**: Traditional capability-based security systems sometimes support a form of caveats or restrictions within the tokens themselves to specify the scope of permissions and the authorized user.

### Discussion on the Leading Hash in Messages

In the PromiseGrid Kernel, messages MAY start with a promise hash followed by a module hash, and then additional arguments. This structure allows receivers to filter messages based on promises they are willing to accept and route the message to the appropriate module. Here are the pros and cons of the promise hash coming first:

**Pros:**
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Placing the promise hash first allows modules and nodes to quickly filter messages based on the promises they accept.
- **Trust and Governance**: This aligns with decentralized governance. Nodes can establish trust relationships by agreeing on specific promises they will accept.
- **Modular Routing**: Early identification of the promise allows the kernel to route messages to the appropriate module, ensuring efficient distributed handling.

**Cons:**
- **Complexity in Parsing**: Parsing multiple hashes increases the complexity of message handling.
- **Overhead**: Including multiple hashes adds overhead to message size, though this is generally offset by the efficiency gains in routing and filtering.

### Kernel's Dynamic Handling of Accept and HandleMessage

Implementing an advanced interaction model involves considering different versions of function handling of messages. There are two possible structures: combined functions or separate functions.

### Combined Function:

```go
type Module interface {
    ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
    // Implement logic to process message, which includes accepting and handling
    // Return a promise message with acceptance and handling results or errors
}
```

### Separate Functions:

```go
type Module interface {
    Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error)
    HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error)
}

type LocalCacheModule struct {
    cacheDir string
}

func NewLocalCacheModule(cacheDir string) *LocalCacheModule {
    return &LocalCacheModule{cacheDir: cacheDir}
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) Accept(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) (Message, error) {
   // Implement logic for accepting or rejecting based on parameters
}

func (m *LocalCacheModule) HandleMessage(ctx context.Context, parms ...interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    // Implement logic for handling the message after acceptance
}
```

### Conclusion

By integrating promises at every level and implementing a hierarchical syscall tree with caching and acceptance history, PromiseGrid ensures trust, accountability, and efficient message handling in a decentralized governance framework. The simplified message structure and consistent handling of cache and modules contribute to a robust and flexible system.
