# Side Effects in PromiseGrid

## Assumption of Side Effects

In PromiseGrid, it is essential to assume that every call has a side effect, meaning it changes the state of the universe. This assumption is foundational because if a call had no side effect, there would be no reason to make it. Side effects are central to the functionality of PromiseGrid, as they represent the changes and actions that occur within the system through promise fulfillment.

### Significance of Side Effects

Making promises and fulfilling them inherently implies state changes. When a promise is made, it sets the expectation that something will happen or some state will change once the promise is fulfilled. This change could be anything from updating a data record, sending a message, or modifying configuration settings. By design, these side effects are what drive the system forward and enable it to perform meaningful tasks.

### Managing Side Effects

Axiom: Every call has a side effect.
Axiom: Side effects are never fully known, because they can change state outside the system.

## Relationships Between Promises, Reputation, and Side Effects

In PromiseGrid, the interplay between promises, reputation, and side effects is critical. Each aspect influences and supports the others, creating a robust and self-regulating system.

### Promise and Side Effect Guarantees

When a module makes a promise, it implicitly guarantees that a particular side effect will occur upon fulfillment. This guarantee forms the basis for trust within the system. Users and other modules rely on these promises to function correctly, knowing that the promised side effects should be realized.  XXX

### Reputation as a Measure of Reliability

Reputation in PromiseGrid acts as a measure of how reliably a module or node fulfills its promises and manages side effects. A high reputation indicates a history of successfully fulfilling promises and causing the expected side effects. Conversely, a low reputation signals frequent breakages of promises or inconsistent side effects, making the entity less trustworthy.

#### How Reputation Affects Promises and Side Effects

1. **Decision Making**: Reputation impacts decision-making within the system. Nodes or modules with higher reputations are more likely to be chosen for critical tasks, as their side effects are deemed more reliable.
2. **Priority Handling**: Promises from high-reputation entities can be prioritized, ensuring that their side effects are applied swiftly to maintain system efficiency.
3. **Accountability**: Breakages in promises (i.e., unfulfilled side effects) negatively impact reputation, providing a self-regulating mechanism that discourages unreliable behavior.

### Promise and Side Effect Documentation

For each promise, the associated side effects should be well-documented. This documentation includes a description of the expected state changes and any potential impact on other parts of the system. By clearly defining the side effects, the system ensures transparency and predictability, making it easier to trust and verify the promises made.

### Example of Interplay:

Consider a scenario where a node promises to update a database record. The side effect of this promise would be the actual updating of the record. If the node consistently fulfills such promises, its reputation would improve, leading to more trust and potential prioritization in future tasks. Conversely, failing to update the record or causing inconsistencies would harm its reputation, making it less likely to be trusted with similar tasks.

## Conclusion

Assuming side effects are an inherent part of every call in PromiseGrid underscores the importance of promises and their fulfillment. The relationship between promises, reputation, and side effects creates a system where trust, reliability, and accountability are paramount. By ensuring side effects are managed and documented correctly, PromiseGrid maintains a robust and efficient framework for decentralized operations.
