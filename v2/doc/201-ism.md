# Infinite State Machines (ISMs) in Sequence Completion for PromiseGrid

## Introduction

In PromiseGrid, an Infinite State Machine (ISM) enables dynamic handling and completion of sequences. Unlike finite state machines, ISMs have an unbounded set of states, offering flexibility in computation and data management. This document discusses ISMs' principles, sequence completion using "what's next" assertions in a graph, and the graph's role as the ISM's execution journal.

### Agent Assertions and Promises

Agents within PromiseGrid make assertions, which are formalized as promises. An assertion signifies a commitment by an agent to perform a specific action or fulfill a particular role within the system. These promises are reciprocated as agents respond to each other's assertions, establishing a network of mutual commitments. When conflicting assertions arise, agents weigh these by leveraging their personal currency values, which reflect their reputation and reliability. This economic weighting ensures that more trusted and reputable agents have their assertions prioritized, maintaining overall system stability and trustworthiness. Unlike traditional function calls, which are often seen as impositions directing an agent to perform a task, assertions are voluntary promises that embody trust and collaboration within the network.

## Understanding Infinite State Machines (ISMs)

### What is an ISM?

An ISM extends finite state machines by allowing unlimited states and transitions. 

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **Unbounded States**: ISMs create and transition to new states as needed.
2. **Dynamic Transitions**: Transitions are determined by events and the current state, enabling adaptive behavior.
3. **Self-Modifying Execution**: ISMs can alter their structure and behavior during execution to handle complex tasks.

### Are ISMs Turing-Equivalent?

ISMs, with their unbounded states and transitions, can be Turing-equivalent, meaning they can perform any computation a Turing machine can, given enough resources.

#### Turing Equivalence:

1. **Unbounded Memory**: ISMs simulate a Turing machine's tape by dynamically creating states.
2. **Conditional Transitions**: Implementing conditional logic allows iterative and recursive computations.
3. **Halting Behavior**: The universe does not halt, but there may need to be a way for an agent to assert "there is no next state".

## Sequence Completion in ISMs

### Implementing Sequence Completion

PromiseGrid uses "what's next" assertions in a graph structure to complete sequences, predicting and executing the next state based on the current state and event.

#### Assertions of "What's Next":

1. **Graph Representation**: sequences are paths in a graph, with nodes as states and edges as transitions.
2. **Dynamic Assertions**: Possible transitions are asserted based on current inputs, guiding completion.
3. **Path Selection**: The most probable path is chosen based on historical data and context for efficient completion.

### ISM Transitions as "What's Next" Predictions

Each ISM transition acts as a "what's next" prediction within the graph structure.
