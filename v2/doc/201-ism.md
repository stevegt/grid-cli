# Infinite State Machines (ISMs) in Sequence Completion for PromiseGrid

## Introduction

In PromiseGrid, an Infinite State Machine (ISM) enables dynamic sequence handling and completion. Unlike finite state machines, ISMs have an unbounded set of states, providing flexibility in computation and data management. This document covers the principles of ISMs, sequence completion using "what's next" assertions in a graph, and the graph's role as the ISM's execution journal.

### Agent Assertions and Promises

- **Assertions as Promises**: Agents make assertions formalized as promises, indicating that the assertion payload is the next event, state, or both in the sequence.
- **Reputation Staking**: By making a promise, an agent stakes its reputation (currency value) on the assertion's correctness.
- **Reciprocal Promises**: Agents respond to each other's assertions, creating a network of states and transitions.
- **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicting assertions arise, agents leverage the asserters' currency values — reflecting reputation and reliability — to prioritize assertions.
- **Economic Weighting**: Ensures trusted and reputable agents have their assertions prioritized, maintaining system stability and trustworthiness.
- **Voluntary Collaboration**: Unlike traditional function calls that direct tasks, assertions are voluntary promises fostering trust and collaboration within the network.

## Understanding Infinite State Machines (ISMs)

### What is an ISM?

An ISM extends finite state machines by allowing unlimited states and transitions.

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **Unbounded States**: ISMs create and transition to new states as needed.
2. **Dynamic Transitions**: Transitions depend on events and the current state, enabling adaptive behavior.
3. **Self-Modifying Execution**: ISMs can alter their structure and behavior during execution to handle complex tasks.

### Are ISMs Turing-Equivalent?

With unbounded states and transitions, ISMs can be Turing-equivalent, meaning they can perform any computation a Turing machine can, given sufficient resources.

#### Turing Equivalence:

1. **Unbounded Memory**: ISMs simulate a Turing machine's tape by dynamically creating states.
2. **Conditional Transitions**: Conditional logic allows for iterative and recursive computations.
3. **Halting Behavior**: The universe does not halt, but agents may need to assert "there is no next state".

## Sequence Completion in ISMs

### Implementing Sequence Completion

PromiseGrid uses "what's next" assertions within a graph structure to complete sequences, predicting and executing the next state based on the current state and event.

#### Assertions of "What's Next":

1. **Graph Representation**: Sequences are paths in a graph, with nodes as states and edges as transitions.
2. **Dynamic Assertions**: Possible transitions are asserted based on current inputs, guiding completion.
3. **Path Selection**: The most probable path is chosen based on historical data and context for efficient completion.

### ISM Transitions as "What's Next" Predictions

Each ISM transition serves as a "what's next" prediction within the graph structure.
