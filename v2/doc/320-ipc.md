# Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in PromiseGrid

## Introduction

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is a critical aspect of any microkernel architecture, facilitating communication between various modules or components. This document explores common microkernel IPC patterns and their implementation within the PromiseGrid microkernel.

## Common Microkernel IPC Patterns

### 1. Message Passing

**Pattern**: In many microkernel systems, IPC is implemented using message passing. Processes or modules communicate by sending and receiving messages through well-defined interfaces.
- **Example**: The Mach microkernel uses message-passing IPC to facilitate communication between different parts of the system.

**In PromiseGrid**:
- The PromiseGrid microkernel employs a message-passing IPC mechanism. Messages in PromiseGrid are encapsulated in structures that include parameters (parms), a leading promise hash, and a module hash.
- This design facilitates efficient and secure communication between modules, aligning with PromiseGrid’s decentralized and modular architecture.

### 2. Shared Memory

**Pattern**: Shared memory allows multiple processes to access the same memory space, enabling fast data exchange.
- **Example**: Systems like QNX use shared memory as a high-performance IPC mechanism in certain situations.

**In PromiseGrid**:
- While shared memory is not the primary IPC mechanism in PromiseGrid, caches treated as shared resources can be conceptually aligned with this pattern.
- Modules in PromiseGrid can cache results, which are then accessible to other modules, facilitating efficient data sharing while maintaining modularity.

### 3. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

**Pattern**: RPC involves executing a procedure (subroutine) on a remote server or component as if it were a local call. This abstracts the details of communication, providing a simple interface for IPC.
- **Example**: The L4 microkernel and other similar systems use RPC for IPC.

**In PromiseGrid**:
- Message handling in PromiseGrid can be seen as a form of RPC. Each message includes a hash that identifies the module and procedure to be executed. The kernel routes the message to the appropriate module based on these hashes.
- This aligns with PromiseGrid’s promise-based interactions, encapsulating functionality and communication in promise messages.

## PromiseGrid Microkernel: A Message-Passing System?

### Is PromiseGrid a Message-Passing Microkernel?

Yes, the PromiseGrid microkernel is a message-passing system. It primarily uses messages to facilitate communication and coordination between nodes and modules in the grid.

### Message Format Comparison

1. **Internal IPC Messages**:
   - Messages used for internal IPC in the PromiseGrid microkernel include a leading promise hash, a module hash, and parameters (parms).
   - **Structure**: 
     ```json
     {
       "promiseHash": "<promise-hash>",
       "moduleHash": "<module-hash>",
       "parms": ["<param1>", "<param2>", ...]
     }
     ```
   
2. **External Network Messages**:
   - Messages exchanged over the network between PromiseGrid nodes are similarly structured and may include additional metadata for routing and security.
   - **Consistency**: The internal IPC messages and network messages maintain a consistent format, simplifying the translation and handling of messages as they traverse nodes.

### Integration with Broader Concepts

1. **Promises All the Way Down**:
   - Both IPC and external network messages in PromiseGrid are promise-based. This ensures a unified model for interaction, governance, and communication.
   - **Unified Handling**: The system treats every interaction as a promise, ensuring a consistent and trustworthy communication framework.

## Conclusion

The PromiseGrid microkernel leverages common IPC patterns, primarily using message passing to facilitate communication between modules. By incorporating promise-based interactions and maintaining a consistent message format both internally and over the network, PromiseGrid ensures efficient and secure module coordination. This design aligns with the principles of decentralized governance and modularity, ensuring a robust and flexible system architecture.
