# Issues, Problems, and Open Questions

## Review Summary

The following document reviews the current state of the PromiseGrid documentation, highlighting issues, problems, and open questions that need addressing to improve clarity, comprehensiveness, and technical accuracy.

## General Issues

### 1. Consistency in Terminology
- **Problem**: Inconsistent use of terminology across documents, such as "message ports" and "IPC mechanisms".
- **Solution**: Establish a glossary of terms and ensure consistent usage throughout the documentation.

### 2. Cross-Referencing Sections
- **Problem**: Lack of cross-references between related sections, making it harder to navigate and understand the comprehensive system.
- **Solution**: Add hyperlinks and references between sections discussing related concepts (e.g., refer from IPC mechanisms to specific examples in PromiseGrid).

## Specific Document Issues

### 320-ipc.md

#### 1. Lack of Examples for Concepts
- **Problem**: The document lacks practical examples and real-world applications of IPC patterns.
- **Solution**: Include more concrete examples and scenarios demonstrating how IPC mechanisms are implemented in PromiseGrid.

#### 2. Byte-Sequence Completion and Trie Explanation
- **Problem**: The explanation of byte-sequence completion and trie structures can be abstract and hard to grasp.
- **Solution**: Enhance explanations with diagrams and step-by-step descriptions to clarify these concepts.

### 321-mach.md

#### 1. Incomplete Message Format Details
- **Problem**: Not all fields in the message structure are explained (e.g., `msgh_bits`, `trailer_type`).
- **Solution**: Provide detailed descriptions of all fields in the Mach message structure to ensure completeness.

#### 2. Practical Usage Scenarios
- **Problem**: Lack of practical usage scenarios for Mach ports and messages.
- **Solution**: Include examples and case studies demonstrating Mach IPC in real-world applications.

### 322-ports.md

#### 1. Code Example Clarity
- **Problem**: Code examples for creating and using message ports could be expanded and clarified.
- **Solution**: Provide more comprehensive code snippets and explanations for better understanding.

#### 2. Detailed Security Considerations
- **Problem**: The document doesn't discuss in detail the security aspects of message ports.
- **Solution**: Add a section specifically addressing security measures and best practices for using message ports in PromiseGrid.

### 323-syscalls.md

#### 1. Dynamic Port Allocation Explanation
- **Problem**: Insufficient details on dynamic port allocation and management.
- **Solution**: Expand the section on dynamic allocation with more examples and technical details.

#### 2. Error Handling Mechanism
- **Problem**: Error handling in syscall mechanisms is not thoroughly explained.
- **Solution**: Include a dedicated section on how errors are managed and propagated in syscall communications.

### 324-syscalls-sequences.md

#### 1. Trie Data Structures Visualization
- **Problem**: The document lacks visual diagrams to illustrate trie structures.
- **Solution**: Incorporate visual aids to help readers better understand the trie data structures and their traversal.

#### 2. Timestamp Handling in Detail
- **Problem**: Timestamp inclusion for side-effect sequences is not deeply explored.
- **Solution**: Provide a more detailed explanation of how timestamps are utilized and managed within the sequence completions.

### 325-mount.md

#### 1. Mount Handler Implementation Examples
- **Problem**: The document needs more concrete examples of mount handler implementations.
- **Solution**: Add detailed implementation examples and scenarios to demonstrate the usage of mount handlers.

#### 2. Comparison with Traditional Mount Tables
- **Problem**: More comparative analysis with traditional UNIX-like global mount tables is needed.
- **Solution**: Expand the explanation on the pros and cons of PromiseGrid's approach versus traditional mount tables.

### 326-prior.md

#### 1. Peer-to-Peer Protocol Details
- **Problem**: Insufficient details on the peer-to-peer protocol used in systems like Corda.
- **Solution**: Provide a deeper dive into the peer-to-peer communication protocols and their role in decentralized trie management.

#### 2. Real-World Case Studies
- **Problem**: Lack of in-depth case studies on the application of decentralized tries.
- **Solution**: Include detailed case studies showcasing how decentralized trie structures are utilized in various systems.

## Open Questions

### 1. Trie Performance Optimization
- How can we further optimize trie performance for high-throughput environments?

### 2. Security of Trie Transitions
- What additional security measures can be implemented to protect against attacks during trie transitions?

### 3. Dynamic Capability Management
- How can we enhance the dynamic allocation and management of capabilities in a decentralized system?

### 4. Advanced Routing Algorithms
- What advanced routing algorithms can be integrated into PromiseGrid to further improve message delivery efficiency?

By addressing these issues, problems, and open questions, the PromiseGrid documentation will be more robust, user-friendly, and technically accurate, aiding developers in effectively utilizing the system.
