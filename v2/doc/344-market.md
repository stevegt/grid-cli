# Pure Market Design with Promises and Reputation

## Introduction

This document outlines a design concept for a pure market system that operates based on promises and reputation, without relying on a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The goal is to create a decentralized market for storage and retrieval services where nodes interact directly based on market dynamics, leveraging promises and reputation to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.

## Core Components

1. **Market Layer**
   - The market layer functions as the primary structure, allowing nodes to trade storage and retrieval services.
   - Nodes offer their storage capacity and bandwidth in exchange for compensation.
   - Market dynamics, such as supply, demand, pricing, and competition, determine the cost and allocation of resources, including data replicas.

2. **Promise Mechanism**
   - Nodes make promises to provide storage and retrieval services under specific terms.
   - Promises include conditions such as duration, capacity, and price.
   - Broken promises negatively impact a node's reputation within the system.

3. **Reputation System**
   - Nodes build and maintain a reputation based on their history of promises and performance.
   - A nodeâ€™s reputation influences its attractiveness and pricing power in the market.

## Design Overview

### Market Layer

#### Market Mechanics
- **Supply/Demand Replcation:** Nodes MAY voluntarily store and offer copies of high-value data based on market pricing or volume.
- **Storage Offers:** Nodes advertise their available storage capacity. Each offer includes specifics such as price, duration, and conditions.
- **Bidding:** Nodes in need of storage place bids, proposing terms for storing their data. The market matches offers and bids based on compatibility and preferences.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Prices for storage and retrieval services are dynamic, influenced by demand, supply, and competition among nodes.

#### Transactions
- **Promises and Capabilities:** Promises detail the terms of service. Capabilities grant access to the provided services.
- **Broken Promise Accounting:** The system tracks broken promises, which affect a node's reputation. Frequent failures result in lower reputation scores, discouraging poor performance.

## Data Storage and Retrieval

### Storage Process
1. **Identification:** Data to be stored is assigned a unique identifier using a cryptographic hash function.
2. **Market Interaction:** The node seeking storage interacts with the market layer, finding a suitable storage offer.
3. **Promise Formation:** A promise is formed and agreed upon by both parties, outlining the storage terms.
4. **Data Chunking:** If necessary, the data is divided into chunks and distributed to the selected storage nodes as per the promise.
5. **Replication:** The data is replicated across multiple nodes by market forces and/or separate promises to ensure reliability.

### Retrieval Process
1. **Identification:** The key associated with the data is used to locate the data within the network.
2. **Market Interaction:** The node seeking to retrieve the data interacts with the market to find retrieval offers.
3. **Promise Formation:** A retrieval promise is established, specifying the retrieval terms.
4. **Data Transfer:** The data is retrieved from the storage nodes and transferred to the requesting node as per the promise conditions.

## Market Dynamics

### Incentive Structures
- **Quality of Service (QoS):** Nodes are incentivized to provide high-quality storage and retrieval services, reflected in their reputation. Higher reliability and faster access times attract higher prices.
- **Reputation Impact:** Nodes failing to meet their promises face a degradation in their reputation, which discourages poor performance and broken promises.

### Competitive Environment
- **Differentiation:** Nodes can differentiate themselves based on their QoS offerings, such as uptime, speed, and reliability.
- **Reputation Systems:** A robust reputation system tracks the performance and reliability of nodes, influencing their attractiveness and opportunities in the market.

## Security Considerations

### Data Integrity and Privacy
- **Cryptographic Hashing:** Each data chunk is signed with a cryptographic hash to ensure integrity and detect tampering.
- **Encryption:** Data can be encrypted before storage to maintain privacy, with only authorized nodes having access to decryption keys.

### Trust and Verification
- **Decentralized Trust:** The system minimizes the reliance on central authorities, relying instead on cryptographic promises and reputation systems to foster trust.
- **Auditability:** All transactions, promises, and broken promises are logged and auditable to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Transaction Logs

### Storage of Transaction Logs
- **Hashed Blobs:** Transaction logs are stored within the system as hashed blobs, ensuring their integrity, verifiability, and availability throughout the network.

## Conclusion

The pure market design with promises and reputation aims to create a decentralized and dynamic market for storage and retrieval services. By eliminating the DHT layer, the system focuses on direct interactions between nodes based on market principles and reputation. Future work will involve refining the economic models, enhancing security mechanisms, and optimizing performance to ensure a robust and reliable market system.
