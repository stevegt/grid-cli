# Module-Based Decentralized System Using WASM

## Introduction

WebAssembly (WASM) is a powerful choice for implementing module-based decentralized systems that incorporate both browser-based and standalone nodes. WASM provides a common runtime that can execute code consistently across different environments, ensuring security, speed, and flexibility. This document discusses the advantages of using WASM in such a system and explores plugin architectures, especially in the Go programming language.

## Advantages of Using WASM

### 1. Platform Independence

WASM is designed to be a low-level assembly-like language that can run on any platform with a WASM runtime. This characteristic makes it ideal for a decentralized system where modules may run in various environments, including browsers, servers, and standalone applications.

### 2. Security

WASM runs in a sandboxed environment, which ensures that the execution of code is isolated from the host system. This isolation is crucial for decentralized systems where untrusted code from different nodes may need to be executed safely.

### 3. Performance

WASM provides near-native performance because it is designed to be executed by a stack-based virtual machine. This performance boost is essential for decentralized systems that require efficient execution of code across multiple nodes.

### 4. Interoperability

WASM can interoperate with other languages and technologies, enabling developers to write modules in their preferred programming languages and compile them to WASM. This flexibility is valuable in a decentralized environment with diverse development requirements.

## Plugin Architectures in Go

Go is a popular language for building backend services due to its concurrency model and performance. Go's has a less-flexible plugin architecture; WASM provides one that is more flexible and heterogeneous.

### Dynamic Module Loading

Using WASM, developers can create modules that can be dynamically loaded and executed by a host system. This capability allows for the creation of modular systems where new functionalities can be added or updated without restarting the entire system.

### Scenario: Decentralized Application

Consider a decentralized application where different nodes perform various tasks. Each task can be implemented as a WASM module, ensuring platform-independent execution. These modules can be dynamically loaded by the Go-based core system, allowing for scalable and maintainable development.

1. **Module Development**:
   - Develop modules in a high-level language (e.g., Rust, AssemblyScript).
   - Compile modules to WASM.

**Example Workflow:**

```plaintext
Node A         Node B         Node C
   |              |              |
+-------+      +-------+      +-------+
| WASM  |      | WASM  |      | WASM  |
| Module|      | Module|      | Module|
+-------+      +-------+      +-------+
   |              |              |
   +-------Go-based Core System------> Manage and Execute Modules
```

## Conclusion

WASM provides a robust framework for implementing module-based decentralized systems, offering advantages in platform independence, security, and performance.
