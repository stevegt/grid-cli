# PromiseGrid Kernel

## Introduction

The PromiseGrid kernel is a crucial component designed to manage the core functionalities of the system. This document delineates the kernel's role and responsibilities, alongside clarifying the tasks that fall outside its scope, which should be handled by modules.

## Role and Responsibilities of the PromiseGrid Kernel

### Core Functions

1. **Message Handling**:
    - The kernel is responsible for routing incoming messages based on their byte sequences. It ensures each message reaches the appropriate module for processing.
    - It employs a trie-based structure for efficient sequence matching and completion, dynamically adapting to new sequences and optimizing future lookups.
    - **Caching**: The kernel dynamically handles message caching, ensuring rapid retrieval and minimized redundant processing.

2. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:
    - Manages IPC mechanisms within the system, facilitating communication between different modules.
    - Provides standardized ports for message passing, ensuring seamless interactions between various components.
    - The kernel uses calls and callbacks to transfer messages between user-space modules and kernel services efficiently.
    - **Ports Explained**: Each module is allocated standard ports analogous to stdin, stdout, and stderr at load time. Additionally, modules can dynamically request other ports as needed, and these ports serve as conduits for message-passing between modules. This setup ensures modularity and flexibility in communication.

3. **Resource Management**:
    - Allocates and manages resources required for modules to function effectively.
    - Ensures fair distribution of resources and handles contention scenarios to maintain system stability and performance.
    - **Dynamic Allocation**: Resources are dynamically allocated based on module requirements and system load. This management is critical for maintaining optimal performance and preventing resource starvation.

4. **Security and Validation**:
    - Enforces security protocols to protect against unauthorized access and data tampering.
    - Validates the integrity of incoming messages and requests before routing them to the appropriate handlers.
    - **Security Implementation**: The kernel deploys an internal firewall and IPC message filter to scrutinize and validate messages, ensuring they meet predefined security criteria.

5. **Cache Management**:
    - Implements and manages the system's cache, treating modules as caches and consulting them in the event of cache misses.
    - Ensures efficient data retrieval and storage by dynamically maintaining and updating the cache.
    - **Cache Mechanism**: The kernel uses a trie-based structure to manage cached data, indexing disk and network caches dynamically and hierarchically.

6. **Promise Handling**:
    - Central to the system's functioning, the kernel handles promises made by modules. It maintains a record of promises, tracks their fulfillment, and manages broken promises.
    - **Promise Management**: The completion statuses and content of promises are stored within the trie, allowing efficient tracking and retrieval of promise states.

### Delegation to Modules

While the kernel handles core functionalities, it delegates specific operations to specialized modules. This ensures modularity and allows the system to remain flexible and adaptable.

1. **Non-Sandboxed Modules**:
    - Similar to device drivers in a microkernel OS, non-sandboxed modules handle specific external operations (e.g., network communications, file access).
    - The kernel oversees overall execution but delegates these specialized tasks to appropriate modules.

2. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
    - The kernel adapts to changing requirements by delegating new tasks to dynamically loaded modules.
    - Modules can update their capabilities on-the-fly, allowing the kernel to manage system operations efficiently.
    - **Module Registration**: Modules register their capabilities with the kernel, which then invokes these modules as needed based on message sequences and resource availability.

## What the Kernel is NOT Responsible For

### Module-Specific Operations

1. **Network Communications**:
    - Direct network communication tasks are handled by dedicated modules, not the kernel.
    - The kernel facilitates the setup and management of these modules, ensuring they have the necessary resources and permissions.
    - **Implementation Example**: A module handles the network stack for sending and receiving packets, while the kernel routes messages to this module as needed.

2. **File System Access**:
    - The kernel does not directly handle file system interactions. These responsibilities are assigned to modules designed to manage such operations.
    - It ensures modules comply with security protocols and have appropriate access controls.
    - **Example**: A file system module manages data read/write operations, and the kernel consults this module for file-related requests.

3. **Application Logic**:
    - The kernel provides the infrastructure for running application-specific logic but does not implement the logic itself.
    - This logic resides within application modules and external services interfaced by these modules.
    - **Example**: Business logic for processing transactions is implemented in application modules, which the kernel invokes based on message sequences.

### Example Illustrations

1. **Cache Miss Handling**:
    - Upon a cache miss, the kernel does not fetch the requested data itself. Instead, it consults one or more modules that can provide the data dynamically.
    - Modules may then contribute the data back to the kernel, which updates the cache accordingly.
    - **Workflow**: The kernel identifies a cache miss and routes the request to a data-fetching module. This module retrieves the data from an external source, returns it to the kernel, which then updates its cache.

2. **Error Logging and Handling**:
    - While the kernel may track and report errors, detailed logging and specific error handling processes are managed by modules.
    - **Example**: If a module fails to fulfill a promise, it sends an error message to the kernel's stderr equivalent port. The kernel logs this error and routes it to an appropriate error-handling module for resolution. This architecture ensures that error management remains modular and extensible.

3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**:
    - The kernel dynamically allocates resources to modules based on their demands and overall system load. However, the actual usage and management of these resources are handled by the modules themselves.
    - **Illustration**: A module requests additional memory for a compute-intensive task. The kernel allocates this memory, but the module manages its usage and ensures it's returned after completion.

## Conclusion

The PromiseGrid kernel serves as the backbone of the system, managing core functionalities such as message handling, IPC, resource management, and promise handling. It delegates specific tasks like network communication, file access, and application logic to specialized modules, ensuring a modular and flexible architecture. By clearly defining its roles and responsibilities, the kernel ensures the efficient and scalable operation of the PromiseGrid system.
