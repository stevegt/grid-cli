# PromiseGrid Kernel

## Introduction

The PromiseGrid kernel is a crucial component designed to manage the core functionalities of the system. This document delineates the kernel's role and responsibilities, alongside clarifying the tasks that fall outside its scope, which should be handled by modules.

## Role and Responsibilities of the PromiseGrid Kernel

### Core Functions

1. **Message Handling**:
    - The kernel is responsible for routing incoming messages based on their byte sequences. It ensures each message reaches the appropriate module for processing.
    - It employs a trie-based structure for efficient sequence matching and completion, dynamically adapting to new sequences and optimizing future lookups.

2. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:
    - Manages IPC mechanisms within the system, facilitating communication between different modules.
    - Provides standardized ports for message passing, ensuring seamless interactions between various components.
    - XXX describe ports
    - The kernel uses calls and callbacks to transfer messages between user-space modules and kernel services efficiently.

3. **Resource Management**:
    - Allocates and manages resources required for modules to function effectively.
    - Ensures fair distribution of resources and handles contention scenarios to maintain system stability and performance.

4. **Security and Validation**:
    - Enforces security protocols to protect against unauthorized access and data tampering.
    - Validates the integrity of incoming messages and requests before routing them to the appropriate handlers.
    - XXX why and how, or don't do it in the kernel
    - XXX internal firewall, IPC message filter?

5. **Cache Management**:
    - Implements and manages the system's cache, treating modules as caches and consulting them in the event of cache misses.
    - Ensures efficient data retrieval and storage by dynamically maintaining and updating the cache.
    - XXX how?

6. **Promise Handling**:
    - Central to the system's functioning, the kernel handles promises made by modules. It maintains a record of promises, tracks their fulfillment, and manages broken promises.
    - XXX how?
    - Uses the trie-based structure to store and track promise completions efficiently.

### Delegation to Modules

While the kernel handles core functionalities, it delegates specific operations to specialized modules. This ensures modularity and allows the system to remain flexible and adaptable.

1. **Non-Sandboxed Modules**:
    - Similar to device drivers in a microkernel OS, non-sandboxed modules handle specific external operations (e.g., network communications, file access).
    - The kernel oversees the overall execution but delegates these specialized tasks to appropriate modules.

2. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
    - The kernel adapts to changing requirements by delegating new tasks to dynamically loaded modules.
    - Modules can update their capabilities on-the-fly, allowing the kernel to manage system operations efficiently.

## What the Kernel is NOT Responsible For

### Module-Specific Operations

1. **Network Communications**:
    - Direct network communication tasks are handled by dedicated modules, not the kernel.
    - The kernel facilitates the setup and management of these modules, ensuring they have the necessary resources and permissions.

2. **File System Access**:
    - The kernel does not directly handle file system interactions. These responsibilities are assigned to modules designed to manage such operations.
    - It ensures modules comply with security protocols and have appropriate access controls.

3. **Application Logic**:
    - The kernel provides the infrastructure for running application-specific logic but does not implement the logic itself.
    - This logic resides within application modules and external services interfaced by these modules.

### Example Illustrations

1. **Cache Miss Handling**:
    - Upon a cache miss, the kernel does not fetch the requested data itself. Instead, it consults one or more modules that can provide the data dynamically.
    - Modules may then contribute the data back to the kernel, which updates the cache accordingly.
    - XXX conflict:  does the kernel update its cache, or does the module update its own cache?

2. **Error Logging and Handling**:
    - While the kernel may track and report errors, detailed logging and specific error handling processes are managed by modules.
    - XXX example
    - This separation ensures that the kernel remains lightweight and efficient while modules handle more complex error resolution tasks.

## Conclusion

The PromiseGrid kernel serves as the backbone of the system, managing core functionalities such as message handling, IPC, resource management, and promise handling. It delegates specific tasks like network communication, file access, and application logic to specialized modules, ensuring a modular and flexible architecture. By clearly defining its roles and responsibilities, the kernel ensures an efficient and scalable operation of the PromiseGrid system.
