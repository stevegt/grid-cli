# Unit-Specific Ledgers for Digital Currencies

1. **Delegated Signing Authority**: Instead of having the currency issuer sign every transaction, signing authority for specific currency serial numbers can be delegated to trusted third parties, similar to how physical and electronic currencies work today. This decentralizes the system and improves scalability.
   
2. **Serial Number-Specific Ledgers**: Each currency unit (serial number) can maintain its own public ledger, tracking all transactions involving that specific unit. This ledger allows anyone to verify ownership and detect issues like double-spending after the fact.

3. **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: If double-spending occurs, it can be detected by identifying conflicting ledgers for the same serial number. The network can compare the ledgers, determine the valid transaction, and flag the other as invalid.

4. **Byte Sequence Completion for Auditing**: A key protocol feature is the ability to complete the ledger for a given serial number using the byte sequence completion mechanism. This enables any party to retrieve all transactions related to that serial number and identify potential double-spending or manipulation.

5. **Reputation and Exchange Rate Adjustments**: Based on the detection of double-spending or manipulation, parties in the network can adjust exchange rates and reputation dynamically, penalizing bad actors through market mechanisms.

This approach combines decentralized verification, transparency, and reputation-driven incentives to maintain trust and security in the system without relying on a central authority.
