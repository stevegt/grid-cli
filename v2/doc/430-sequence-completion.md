# Byte Sequence Completion in PromiseGrid

## Overview

PromiseGrid's core computational model revolves around **byte sequence completion**. Tasks, data retrieval, and inter-agent communications are executed as sequences of bytes.

## Byte Sequence Completion Model

### Concept

- **Byte Sequences as Computations**: Encodes any computable function or data.
- **Referential Transparency**: Functions produce consistent outputs for the same inputs.

### Execution Flow

1. **Initiation**: An agent sends a byte sequence representing a task.
2. **Matching**: The system identifies processing methods.
3. **Completion**: The system computes the result.
4. **Unmatched Sequences**: Delegated to capable agents.
5. **Response**: The sequence is completed and returned.

## Implementation

### Communication and Messaging

- **Predictable Operations**: Agents use byte sequences as pure functions.
- **Dynamic Routing**: The system routes messages based on sequence completion ability.
- layering: The choice of agent to route to might be determined by promise make/break reputation scores as tracked by agent personal currencies, but this detail is abstracted from the sequence completion layer.

### Storage and Cache Management

- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Data and code are accessed based on byte sequences.
- **Caching**: Associations between input sequences and results for faster access.
- **Distributed Management**: Supports decentralized storage and execution.

### Scalability

- **Dynamic Integration**: Easily introduce new sequences.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Decentralized nature enhances resilience.

### Application Examples

- **Function Execution**: Completing sequences to execute functions.
- **Data Retrieval**: Matching sequences to retrieve data.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Exchanging and completing message sequences.
