**Tests**:

- **Scalability Strategies**: Check that the design outlines strategies for scaling horizontally (e.g., adding more nodes) and handling increased load.

- **Performance Metrics**: Verify that performance goals are defined and that the design includes mechanisms to meet these goals (e.g., efficient caching, load balancing).

- **Bottleneck Identification**: Assess the design for potential performance bottlenecks, such as centralized components or resource-intensive operations.

- **Benchmarking Plans**: Ensure that the design includes plans for benchmarking and performance testing.

### 7. Transparency and Auditability

**Goal**: Actions within the system are transparent and auditable, ensuring accountability through comprehensive logging and monitoring.

**Tests**:

- **Logging Mechanisms**: Verify that the design includes mechanisms for logging actions, events, and transactions in the system.

- **Audit Trails**: Ensure that logs are tamper-evident and can be used to trace actions back to their origin.

- **Access to Logs**: Check that appropriate access controls are in place for viewing and analyzing logs.

- **Monitoring Tools**: Assess whether the design provides tools or interfaces for monitoring system performance and behavior.

### 8. Resilience and Fault Tolerance

**Goal**: The system is resilient to failures and includes fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure continued operation and data availability despite node or network failures.

**Tests**:

- **Redundancy**: Verify that data and services are replicated across multiple nodes to prevent single points of failure.

- **Failure Detection**: Check that the system includes mechanisms for detecting node or service failures.

- **Recovery Procedures**: Ensure that the design specifies procedures for automatic recovery or failover when failures occur.

- **Graceful Degradation**: Assess how the system maintains operation under degraded conditions and how it prioritizes essential functions.

### 9. Layer design

**Goal**: The system is designed with clear separation of concerns and well-defined layers for different functionalities.

**Tests**:

- **Layer Definitions**: Verify that the design documents clearly define the different layers of the system and their responsibilities.

- **Inter-Layer Communication**: Check that the design specifies how communication occurs between layers and how data is passed between them.

- **Layer Independence**: Ensure that each layer can operate independently of the others and that changes in one layer do not require modifications in other layers.

- **Layer Abstraction**: Assess how the layers abstract underlying complexities and provide clear interfaces for interaction.

### 10. Runtime simplicity

**Goal**: The system runtime is designed to provide a simple, easily understandable environment for user-developed agents.

**Tests**:

- **Simple API**: Verify that the runtime provides a simple and intuitive API for agent development.
