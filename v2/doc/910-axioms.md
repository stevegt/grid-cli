# Axioms 

## Definition of "Axiom"

An axiom is a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. In the context of PromiseGrid, axioms define the fundamental principles and assumptions upon which the system is built. These foundational truths guide the design, implementation, and operation of the PromiseGrid framework.

### Axioms in PromiseGrid

1. **Decentralization Axiom**:
   - The system must function without reliance on any single centralized control or authority, enabling distributed ownership and operation.

2. **Promise-Based Interaction Axiom**:
   - All interactions within the system are based on promises. A response to any action or request must itself be a promise.

3. **Content-Addressable Storage Axiom**:
   - Data and code within the system are addressed by their content rather than by their location or name.

4. **Modularity Axiom**:
   - The system is composed of modular components that can be developed and upgraded independently while maintaining interoperability.
