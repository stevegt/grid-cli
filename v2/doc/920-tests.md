### **Core Design Tests**

1. **Sequence Completion and Promises**:
   - **Completion requests return Burgess-style promises**, where the reply includes the completed sequence along with a promise that the sequence is correct.
   - **Completion requests themselves are promises**, embedding transactional behavior in the message exchange.
   - **Prefix completion can match fragments**, not just prefixes, allowing for more granular sequence matching and alignment.
   - **Prefix completion supports all DNA sequence operations**, including alignment and matching.

2. **Lowest-Layer API Primitive**:
   - **Sequence completion is the lowest-layer primitive** that the grid kernel supports. All agents send messages using an open/write/close sequence and obtain the result via a hash.
   - The API is minimal and designed around **open(), write(), close(), and read()** calls, supporting both sending messages and retrieving results.
   - **Completion requests are answered with immutable, hash-referenced results**, ensuring referential transparency.

### **Execution and Data Handling Tests**

3. **Multihash as a Sequence Identifier**:
   - **If a hash is encoded with multihash, then it represents a sequence**. Calling `open(hash)` should return a handle that can be read incrementally.
   - **A sequence can reference an algorithm and its arguments**, meaning that `open(sequence)` triggers the execution of the algorithm, and `read(handle)` returns its results incrementally.
   - **Handles are used to stream large messages** or computation results in chunks.

4. **Referential Transparency**:
   - **Opening a sequence by hash always yields the same result**, ensuring that the system is referentially transparent.
   - **Handles act as pointers to immutable sequences**, allowing for efficient streaming of large messages without modifying the underlying data.
   - **Sending a message is semantically a read operation**, where the message is streamed to the recipient.
   - **All operations are referentially transparent**: opening a sequence, reading from it, sending it, and executing a referenced algorithm will always produce the same result for the same input.

### **API Simplification and Data Flow Tests**

5. **Simplified API with Large Message and COW Support**:
   - The simplest possible API that supports large messages, streaming, and COW includes `open()`, `write()`, `close()`, `read()`, and `sendMessage()`.
   - **sendMessage() could be conceptually treated as a read operation**, where the message sequence is streamed to the target port.
   - **`close()` returns the hash of the sequence**, finalizing it and allowing future access via the hash.
   - **Clone operations support copy-on-write (COW)**, allowing efficient data sharing and modification without duplicating immutable sequences.

### **Currency and Economic System Tests**

6. **Currencies as Capabilities**:
   - **A unit of currency is a capability**, meaning agents exchange capabilities rather than traditional currencies.
   - Agents can issue **restricted capabilities** that are not transferrable.
   - **Agents can issue multiple currencies** if capabilities are treated as currencies, and each capability can have unique rules or restrictions.
   - **Completion requests are not currency exchanges**, but currency exchanges can stock up on necessary resources (capabilities) to enable future sequence completion.

7. **Economic and Governance System Flexibility**:
   - The design must support the **evolution of new monetary systems**, including gift economies, defi/blockchain-based systems, or no currency at all.
   - The system is designed to support **fractional reserves**, where agents can issue more capabilities than they hold.
   - **Governance mechanisms** must evolve flexibly, and **layering** is used to separate basic kernel functionality (sequence completion) from higher-level systems like inter-agent coordination, currency management, or economic governance.

### **Decentralized System and Layering Tests**

8. **Routing and Communication Layers**:
   - **Completion as the lowest-layer primitive works fine**, and inter-host routing, IPC, and other higher-level protocols can be implemented on top of this fundamental mechanism.
   - **Layering** allows the system to run **WASM** and **WASI modules**, support virtual desktops, and manage applications across decentralized nodes.
   - **Inter-host communication** should be abstracted into higher layers, with the completion layer remaining simple.

9. **Consistency of Design Across All Layers**:
   - **The sequence completion mechanism** must remain consistent across all levels of the system, from low-level inter-host communication to higher-level virtual desktops and application management.
   - **No layer inversion**: Higher layers build on top of the completion primitive without complicating or changing the fundamental mechanism.
   - **Future-proofed design**: The layering approach ensures that the system can evolve to support new technologies, governance models, and decentralized applications without re-engineering the core.

### **Final Consistency Tests**

10. **Testing Against Gresham's Law**:
   - **Gresham's Law is not a factor** in this system, as agents issue capabilities based on reputation rather than traditional currency mechanics.
   - **Capabilities are non-fungible** and represent an agent's ability to fulfill promises, which decouples the system from standard economic pressures of currency devaluation.
   
11. **Decentralized Matching and Currency Management**:
   - **Matching algorithms** for currencies must be consistent with the sequence completion mechanism, ensuring that trades are settled in a decentralized manner using the sequence completion protocol.
   - **Double-auction mechanisms** must integrate smoothly with the promise system, where each capability is issued based on an agent's ability to fulfill promises, not traditional market dynamics.

### **Computation and Sequence Operations Tests**

12. **Prefix Completion and DNA Sequence Operations**:
   - **Prefix completion** must support not only full matches but also fragments, ensuring flexibility in sequence matching.
   - **Completion requests** must support advanced operations such as **DNA alignment** and **pattern matching**, leveraging the sequence completion mechanism for bioinformatics and data analysis.

13. **Execution and Result Streaming**:
   - **Algorithm execution** is supported by the same sequence completion mechanism, allowing an agent to open and read the results of a computation as though it were a static sequence.
   - The design should support **lazy evaluation** where computations are triggered by opening a sequence, and the results are streamed progressively.
