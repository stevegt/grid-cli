# Goals 

1. **Decentralization**:
   - The system functions without reliance on any single centralized control or authority, enabling distributed ownership and operation.

2. **Promise-Based Interaction**:
   - All interactions within the system are based on promises. A response to any action or request must itself be a promise.

3. **Content-Addressable Storage**:
   - Data and code within the system are addressed by their content rather than by their location or name.

4. **Modularity**:
   - The system is composed of modular components that can be developed and upgraded independently while maintaining interoperability.

5. **Security and Integrity**:
   - Security and data integrity are supported through robust cryptographic methods, including hashing and encryption for both data storage and communication.

6. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - The system is designed for scalability, supporting efficient operation across a wide range of network sizes and performance requirements.

8. **Transparency and Auditability**:
   - Actions within the system are transparent and auditable, ensuring accountability through comprehensive logging and monitoring.

10. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**:
    - The system is resilient to failures and include fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure continued operation and data availability despite node or network failures.
