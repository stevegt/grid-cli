# TODO List for Implementing PromiseGrid Kernel

## Cache Design and Lookup
- Refactor the cache design to use byte sequence completion for key management.
  - remove refernces to `/`-separated cache keys to byte sequence completion.
  - Document the byte sequence management strategy.
- Reimplement the cache index to handle byte sequences, removing dependencies on filesystem operations for key management.

## Dynamic Acceptance History and Syscall Table
- Revamp the acceptance history mechanism to track byte sequence completions.
  - Store positive and negative sequence completions effectively.
  - Populate acceptance and rejection history dynamically during kernel operations.
  - Implement efficient lookup facilities to match message sequences with handlers based on historical completion success rates.

## Implement Ant Routing Mechanism
- Integrate byte sequence completion with the ant routing mechanism.
  - Adapt the ant routing algorithm to cache successful byte sequence paths.
  - Develop a strategy to dynamically adjust routing based on promise fulfillment statistics.

## Promise-Based Design
- Augment cache and syscall tree design to fully integrate with byte sequence completion as a core mechanism:
  - Rework promise handling to support dynamic sequence completion.
  - Investigate and implement strategies for embedding promise validation within byte sequence matching.

## Polymorphic Handling and Error Detection
- Develop error handling routines specific to byte sequence completion.
  - Enhance the dispatching mechanism to manage failures in byte sequence processing gracefully.
  - Implement retries and alternative handler routing based on sequence fulfillment failures.

## File Storage and Byte Sequences
- Migrate storage mechanisms to manage byte sequences efficiently.
  - Replace traditional file key management with content-addressable byte sequences.
  - Ensure compatibility with Origin Private File System (OPFS) and abstract filesystem integration via libraries like `afero`.

## Usability and Documentation
- Improve the documentation on managing and converting sequences:
  - Create clear usage examples and guidelines for byte sequence management.
  - Provide concise guides for converting from legacy filesystem-based cache management to byte sequence completion.

## Review and Refactor
- Conduct a comprehensive review to identify legacy points where `/`-separated cache key handling still exists:
  - Complete refactoring of these sections to support byte sequence completion.
  - Validate the correctness and performance of new implementations in various scenarios.

## Security and Verification
- Assess security implications of new byte sequence completion strategies.
  - Ensure that new designs for caching and syscall mechanisms do not introduce vulnerabilities.
  - Enhance the validation and verification processes to assert the integrity of sequence handling mechanisms.
