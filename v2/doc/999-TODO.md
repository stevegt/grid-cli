# TODO List for Implementing PromiseGrid Kernel

## General Improvements
- Improve documentation clarity and consistency.
- Resolve internal inconsistencies and discuss any remaining conflicts.
- Add logical statements and recommendations in technical sections.
- Include open-ended questions to provoke further discussion and exploration.

## Documentation Refinements
- Identify and resolve any conflicting information within the documentation.
- Ensure all statements are logical and support the overall system architecture.
- Add recommendations and best practices based on the current design.
- List documents that are most similar and could be merged.

## Sections to Merge
- Merge similar documents for coherence and simplification:
  - 001-design.md and 002-design.md: Both outline PromiseGrid’s design principles and core concepts.
  - 003-design.md and 010-cache.md: Both focus on cache and module handling within PromiseGrid.
  - 011-cache.md, 013-cache.md, and 014-cache.md: All discuss caching mechanisms and promise handling in-depth.
  - 190-side-effects.md and 201-computable.md: Both explore theoretical aspects of PromiseGrid’s model.
  - 207-vn-guest.md and 202-von-neumann.md: Discuss hosting conventional systems on PromiseGrid.

## Detailed Task List
- Review the documentation for:
  - Logical flow and coherence.
  - Consistency in terminology usage.
- Resolve any discrepancies or conflicting ideas.
- Detailed descriptions for some of the strategies and methods mentioned:
  - Implement example-based explanations wherever possible.
  - Provide case studies and visual aids to enhance understanding.

## Cache Design and Lookup
- Refactor the cache design to use byte sequence completion for key management.
  - Remove references to `/`-separated cache keys and transition to byte sequence completion.
  - Document the byte sequence management strategy.
- Reimplement the cache index to handle byte sequences, removing dependencies on filesystem operations for key management.

## Dynamic Acceptance History and Syscall Table
- Revamp the acceptance history mechanism to track byte sequence completions.
  - Store positive and negative sequence completions effectively.
  - Populate acceptance and rejection history dynamically during kernel operations.
  - Implement efficient lookup facilities to match message sequences with handlers based on historical completion success rates.

## Implement Ant Routing Mechanism
- Integrate byte sequence completion with the ant routing mechanism.
  - Adapt the ant routing algorithm to cache successful byte sequence paths.
  - Develop a strategy to dynamically adjust routing based on promise fulfillment statistics.

## Promise-Based Design
- Augment cache and syscall tree design to fully integrate with byte sequence completion as a core mechanism:
  - Rework promise handling to support dynamic sequence completion.
  - Investigate and implement strategies for embedding promise validation within byte sequence matching.

## Polymorphic Handling and Error Detection
- Develop error handling routines specific to byte sequence completion:
  - Enhance the dispatching mechanism to manage failures in byte sequence processing gracefully.
  - Implement retries and alternative handler routing based on sequence fulfillment failures.

## File Storage and Byte Sequences
- Migrate storage mechanisms to manage byte sequences efficiently:
  - Replace traditional file key management with content-addressable byte sequences.
  - Ensure compatibility with Origin Private File System (OPFS) and abstract filesystem integration via libraries like `afero`.

## Usability and Documentation
- Improve the documentation on managing and converting sequences:
  - Create clear usage examples and guidelines for byte sequence management.
  - Provide concise guides for converting from legacy filesystem-based cache management to byte sequence completion.

## Review and Refactor
- Conduct a comprehensive review to identify legacy points where `/`-separated cache key handling still exists:
  - Complete refactoring of these sections to support byte sequence completion.
  - Validate the correctness and performance of new implementations in various scenarios.

## Security and Verification
- Assess security implications of new byte sequence completion strategies:
  - Ensure that new designs for caching and syscall mechanisms do not introduce vulnerabilities.
  - Enhance the validation and verification processes to assert the integrity of sequence handling mechanisms.
