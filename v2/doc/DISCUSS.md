## Cache and Module Handling in the PromiseGrid Kernel

### Introduction

In the PromiseGrid Kernel, caching and module handling are central to optimizing and managing the execution and storage of data. This document discusses the strategies and implementation details of these mechanisms, highlighting their alignment with decentralized governance and microkernel architecture principles.

### Cache Structures

2. **Multiple Caches**:
    - There **MAY BE** multiple caches, including the built-in cache in the kernel and caches provided by various modules.
    - The kernel **SHOULD** load the built-in cache from embedded resources using Goâ€™s `embed` feature.
    - The kernel **MAY** use the Origin Private File System (OPFS) for disk file access and **MAY** utilize the `afero` library to abstract filesystem interactions.

### Treating Modules as Caches

1. **Role of Modules**:
    - The kernel **MUST** treat modules as caches. In the event of a cache miss, the kernel **MUST** consult one or more modules to retrieve the requested value.
    - Modules **MAY** contribute to the cache or provide the requested data dynamically.

2. **Unified Interface**:
    - From the caller's perspective, there **SHALL BE** no difference between a cache lookup and a function call. Both operations **SHALL BE** treated as hashed function calls. The caller sends a message with a leading hash and any arguments and receives a message containing the requested content.

### Acceptance and Promises

1. **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Modules **MUST** define acceptance criteria for promises, module hashes, and arguments. This can be implemented as an interface for modules, simplifying the acceptance to a single `Accept()` function.

2. **Promises as Acceptance**:
    - By returning a promise message from `Accept` instead of a boolean, modules provide additional guarantees and meta-information.
    - The acceptance is treated as a commitment to handle the message correctly. If `HandleMessage` fails, it is considered a broken promise.

3. **Ant Routing Mechanism**:
    - The syscall tree acts as an "ant routing" mechanism. In it, we cache the fact that a previous call worked, so in the future, we follow the same path to the same module for similar calls.
    - The syscall tree **MUST** use hierarchical keys and **SHOULD** filter based on whether any module accepts the leading parameters, matches the module hash, and accepts the arguments.

### Integration with Church, Turing, and Chomsky's Concept of "Accept"

1. **Computational Theory**:
    - The term "accept" aligns with Church, Turing, and Chomsky's use in computing theory and languages, where an automaton or machine accepts an input if it reaches an accepting state.
    - In PromiseGrid, modules act as recognizers for specific tasks, based on the promise hash, module hash, and arguments.

2. **Promises All the Way Down**:
    - The concept of "promises all the way down" integrates acceptance as a promise message, enhancing the robustness and trustworthiness of the system.
    - Each layer (modules, syscall tree, kernel) makes and fulfills promises based on the promises made by the layers below it.

### Kernel's Dynamic Syscall Tree

1. **Syscall Table and Acceptance History**:
    - The kernel **SHOULD** use a dynamic syscall table to store positive and negative acceptance history for all modules.
    - This table **SHOULD** start empty and be populated during operation as the kernel consults built-in and other modules to handle received messages.
    - The kernel **MUST** route messages to the module whose syscall table key matches the most leading parameters components, optimizing routing and reducing redundant checks.

### Conclusion

The implementation of caching, module handling, and promise-based acceptance in the PromiseGrid Kernel ensures a robust, flexible, and efficient system for decentralized governance and cooperation. By treating acceptance as a promise and integrating a hierarchical syscall tree with ant routing mechanisms, the kernel maintains trust, accountability, and optimized performance, aligning with principles of computational theory and modular architecture.
