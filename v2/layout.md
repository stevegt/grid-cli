## File Layout and Organization for PromiseGrid v2

### Introduction

This document outlines a better way to organize the content and filenames in PromiseGrid v2. Proper organization facilitates easier navigation, maintenance, and development.

### Proposed Directory Structure

1. **Root Directory**: 
    - `cache.md`: Discusses cache structures and promise handling in the PromiseGrid Kernel.
    - `context.md`: Contains various background information and example conversation flows.
    - `DESIGN.md`: Provides a detailed design document for PromiseGrid.
    - `DISCUSS.md`: Houses discussions on cache and module handling in the kernel.
    - `TODO.md`: A to-do list tracking the implementation progress.

2. **src**: 
    - `modules`: Directory for all the individual modules.
    - `builtin`: Directory for built-in modules.
    - `kernel`: Kernel-specific code.

3. **docs**: 
    - Contains all markdown documentation files and other supporting documents like `README.md`.

4. **tests**: 
    - Directory containing test scripts and test cases.

### Contents of Each File
